00:00:00 Hello everyone, and welcome back to another episode of The Pro Crastinators Podcast. I'm
00:00:09 the best guy ever. And shuffling my deck, shuffling my deck, here's your card. Ooh, that's a loser.
00:00:15 Gibbontake.
00:00:16 What did I do to deserve this?
00:00:19 Oh, you were a bum knee. Welcome, Tom Oliver.
00:00:26 Time to crack open a new can of PCP. It's gonna be a good day.
00:00:32 Indeed.
00:00:33 I thought that was the sound of your bones cracking.
00:00:35 Or did I cut out there? Oh no, oh no. Wait, I'm sorry. I'm Ben Saint, and I'm having
00:00:40 headphone troubles back with you in a hot sec.
00:00:44 It's the Joker, baby. There he is. You drew the Joker and you lose.
00:00:48 Only the most professional. Probably putting the pro in the Pro Crastinators Podcast today,
00:00:52 everybody.
00:00:53 Little dud. Sorry, everybody. Pok√©mon, politics, who knows what we'll get up to this episode.
00:01:00 Band. Band from this discussion for life.
00:01:03 No. Hey, I've got, yeah, you got something to get me.
00:01:06 Well, there's the big issue of the copper, the copper field, the Children's Online Privacy
00:01:13 Protection Act.
00:01:14 Oh yeah, that guy.
00:01:16 That Big Bejesus that's going on.
00:01:19 I don't know many facts. I don't know many facts.
00:01:21 I saw a lot of scares.
00:01:22 I saw Innuendo Studio, no, not Innuendo Studio. I saw Folding Ideas video about it. Basically,
00:01:31 YouTube is a liar and claims that users are more responsible than they actually are, but
00:01:39 it's still a problem because YouTube will probably impose penalties on users.
00:01:45 Well, hang on. Isn't that, isn't the idea that it's not YouTube, but it's, it's like
00:01:50 outside of YouTube, like the state of California.
00:01:52 That's the lie.
00:01:53 That's the lie.
00:01:54 Wait, what about California?
00:01:55 Well, I just thought the copper was like a California state law.
00:01:58 No, it's a federal law from the FTC.
00:02:00 Yeah, it applies to all things.
00:02:02 It's been on the book since 1998, and they refresh it every 10 years or so, but I guess
00:02:07 due to like public outcry, due to some shit with YouTube, they're doing it early.
00:02:10 All right, here's, I watched a couple videos on it. I watched some guy who I don't know
00:02:14 who said he's a lawyer. He seemed very lawyer-y.
00:02:17 He talked about the legal side of it.
00:02:19 I also watched Matt Petz.
00:02:20 Was it legal, legal? Sponsored by Indochino?
00:02:23 I don't think it was. I think it was a different one.
00:02:26 He would be sponsored by Indochino, that dapper fuck.
00:02:29 There's a whole like social media lawyer segment of YouTube now.
00:02:34 Indeed.
00:02:35 Yeah.
00:02:36 But yeah, there was the guy talking about law, and also I watched Matt Petz cry video
00:02:42 about it, where he almost cried.
00:02:44 Wait, really?
00:02:45 Really?
00:02:46 No, fuck.
00:02:47 What a fucking bitch.
00:02:48 That's despicable.
00:02:50 It's not like, it's not like he doesn't do that.
00:02:52 I hate a man who cries.
00:02:53 It's not like he doesn't do that usually.
00:02:54 Like he's got a little bit of glistening in his eyes.
00:02:56 When his editor died, it was called for.
00:02:59 Yes.
00:03:00 When fucking Kyla's coming out, he'd fuck you.
00:03:03 Well, I'm not really...
00:03:04 I kind of like mixed the other video less respectful in going there.
00:03:09 Well, it wasn't like weeping. It was just like, I could see glistening in his eyes.
00:03:12 Like he had been like tear-y or something.
00:03:14 Oh, his eyes are always glistening.
00:03:16 I assume that he feels this way because he feels his work is like potentially in jeopardy.
00:03:20 Yes.
00:03:21 It may, you know, okay.
00:03:22 All right, so from what I gather, the copper had turned a blind eye to YouTube for the
00:03:28 most part, because this is the funniest part, so I'll start with that.
00:03:33 I'm ready to laugh.
00:03:34 YouTube has the thing where you have to be 13 years or over in order to use the site,
00:03:40 and that has been part of the YouTube terms of services, and that's all that jazz says,
00:03:46 and that is copper compliant.
00:03:48 So YouTube was actually doing the right thing.
00:03:51 The thing is copper or the FTC rather clued into the fact that YouTube was knowingly targeting
00:04:02 children because they were bragging about it in media events with shareholders and business
00:04:09 people.
00:04:10 It's like YouTube is the number one place for people 6 to 12.
00:04:14 Little babies with a child brain.
00:04:17 So YouTube basically fucked themselves and everyone else over by bragging about how much
00:04:23 money they were making off of these child viewers that they weren't supposed to be allowed.
00:04:28 YouTube was just fucking these children.
00:04:30 The problem is data collection, right?
00:04:33 The specific problem is the collection of data from kids under 13.
00:04:37 The collection of data of children under 13 is for various reasons like not good, and
00:04:46 the advertising relies on that data so that they can show targeted ads which are much
00:04:52 more CPM, click through, whatever thing.
00:04:56 Can I cut in for a moment?
00:04:58 Yeah, that's what I understood the main issue to be.
00:05:00 So when I saw this, I immediately went in.
00:05:02 I went to all my channels.
00:05:03 I set them to not for kids.
00:05:05 And I am aware that I personally do no data collection of any kind.
00:05:10 So my wonder is just like, am I really in any danger considering I have not?
00:05:15 No, not from the law, but maybe from YouTube.
00:05:19 The thing was, this is where the lawyer guy explained it, and he had an update video where
00:05:25 he allegedly got a call from someone in YouTube who couldn't divulge his name for fear of
00:05:30 retribution.
00:05:32 John YouTube himself.
00:05:34 John YouTube, the whistleblower.
00:05:36 Called in to explain secret facts.
00:05:41 The basic gist is that the law has, in the FTC, it explains that if something is for
00:05:51 adults, geared towards adults, it has adult themes, that is nothing to do with copper.
00:05:58 But if it's aimed at children, and it's for children, and it's all of that stuff, then
00:06:04 your video, if it is collecting data, i.e. monetized, you are liable to get, I don't
00:06:12 know the terminology, but you could get fined $42,000 at least per video, per infringement.
00:06:22 That's what YouTube is telling everyone.
00:06:27 It's either for adults or it's for kids.
00:06:29 There's everybody who is upset and concerned, like Matt Pat, like Arlo, who have child-friendly
00:06:36 aspects to their videos, but aren't entirely child-based.
00:06:40 They are not talking to children, they are talking to people.
00:06:43 They are talking to everyone who would be interested.
00:06:46 Adults like Matt Pat, like myself, I enjoy those videos, they're silly, you could say
00:06:53 what you like about them, but they are very much also a huge kid demographic thing.
00:06:58 They're all ages, all ages, which includes kids.
00:07:02 YouTube did not divulge that in the FTC there is a case for both, there is a middle ground
00:07:09 in the FTC rules that says if you're targeting a general audience and it happens to appeal
00:07:16 to kids, you're not actually infringing.
00:07:21 You're not targeting kids.
00:07:22 You're not targeting kids, you're not doing a frozen Elsa Funko Pop unboxing video.
00:07:29 You're not trying to prey upon the easy clicks of children who don't know what they're doing.
00:07:37 You are making videos that children may or may not enjoy.
00:07:44 So if you're like, you swear sometimes, but you also make fun videos that anyone can enjoy,
00:07:50 you're not actually at risk in terms of the FTC, but the thing is YouTube didn't tell people that
00:07:57 because allegedly, because of this secret phone man, that I mean, I don't know, maybe it's true.
00:08:03 Seems true because YouTube is a company and they don't want to let this information out,
00:08:08 is that it would be bad for them monetarily to allow people to not, like they make it black and white.
00:08:20 It's either for adults or it's for kids and they want people, I guess, to set it for kids just in case.
00:08:29 Because the kid market seems so lucrative and I know that the most profitable channel on YouTube is this.
00:08:34 Nobody will get money from kids' content going forward.
00:08:37 If you are a Spider-Man Elsa video channel man, you going forward will not get money.
00:08:43 That is just how it is.
00:08:44 Sorry, don't you get ads, but it's just not targeted ads anymore?
00:08:48 Yeah, but it's like 2% of the income is targeted ads.
00:08:55 YouTube is the one collecting data, not users.
00:08:59 YouTube is basically trying to pass the responsibility for this onto content creators, which is just stupid.
00:09:08 It's just them shamelessly trying not to suffer consequences for things they did wrong.
00:09:14 And want to continue to do wrong.
00:09:16 They've already paid $170 million in fines.
00:09:18 They've paid a huge big lawsuit settlement fine thing already.
00:09:24 They've given money, but it is in their best interest to make sure that this could not ever possibly happen again.
00:09:31 So they are making it black and white in order to confuse creators and make them scared so that they will set their channel to kids
00:09:39 so that they'll lose out on monetization, but they will guarantee that they won't get fined for thousands of dollars suddenly out of nowhere.
00:09:49 Supposedly, even if you set your channel to my content is not for kids, the algorithm might decide that that's just wrong.
00:09:58 The algorithm might theoretically pick up on song keywords and images and stuff and be like, this is kid entertainment.
00:10:07 This is unacceptable for targeted advertisement.
00:10:11 On the one hand, I don't know if YouTube has any intention of making sure...
00:10:21 YouTube doesn't really care about all this.
00:10:25 If they can get away with not doing anything, they will.
00:10:28 The FTC is the one who's going to be scouring through YouTube to find offending videos and they are working with YouTube to make it happen.
00:10:36 But YouTube has no reason, aside from general compliance, to make a bot and AI that finds all of the kid videos and gets them fined for thousands of dollars because that's just bad PR.
00:10:48 I believe that they did do that. They're not looking to find themselves, but they're looking to mark content as kid content and de-target ads from it.
00:11:01 Or something.
00:11:03 There's lots of stuff we don't know because it's YouTube and they're not going to tell us anything.
00:11:08 I'm looking at my analytics right now on the YouTube studio thing.
00:11:13 We all know that every kid lies to get onto YouTube and just says their age is older than it actually is or whatever.
00:11:20 My audience is 80% 18-34 and the 13-17 is just under 7% and I set my challenge to adult and I know that the content is not catered to kids.
00:11:34 Theoretically, you could potentially make an argument that anime is inherently childish and I'm probably going to make a video about Pokemon and other things.
00:11:44 I could see an argument, but I think I could win that argument.
00:11:47 I personally feel very little danger for something like this.
00:11:51 I saw the internet historian, he made a tweet thread basically saying this isn't something to worry about for most people who aren't on the borderline.
00:12:01 But I do feel for people like Arlo and MatPat to a degree who are forced into this uncomfortable position of forcing to choose.
00:12:09 They're only forced into that position because YouTube wanted to do that. They aren't actually in violation of anything.
00:12:17 No.
00:12:19 To be slightly fair to YouTube, it's like YouTube set up this system.
00:12:23 We should at least examine the other side of the argument, which is just that YouTube set up a system where these creators do benefit.
00:12:30 If YouTube's able to milk more money out of these kids, people with a kid audience to any degree have been benefiting from that.
00:12:37 It literally doesn't matter because it's not about who benefits, it's about the collection of data, which only YouTube does.
00:12:43 That data is used to serve ads which makes more money, right?
00:12:46 Yes, by YouTube. And they could choose not to do that, but they won't.
00:12:52 They're just going to pass the buck onto creators and say that it's their problem, whether the data they're collecting is from kids or not.
00:12:59 There has been some benefit to the creators from this.
00:13:01 It literally isn't unrelated to the question at hand.
00:13:05 I don't think, I mean, they have in fact gained more money through this system.
00:13:09 That makes, that is not what the question is.
00:13:12 Well, okay, if you want to talk about something else, fair enough.
00:13:14 I want to talk about Kappa, which is not about who's getting money, it's about collection of data.
00:13:21 I mean, I agree.
00:13:23 What Nate's trying to say, I think, is that because YouTube for so long has not been in compliance with Kappa,
00:13:31 there's an entire market that's sprung up around making money off of children.
00:13:35 And even if someone like Arlo has been benefiting from that indirectly because these children...
00:13:43 I don't know if that's true. I don't think Arlo's videos are not the kind of thing we're talking about.
00:13:47 I have the mind of a child. And when I see Arlo, I go buck wild.
00:13:50 It's just what it is.
00:13:52 Arlo is a...
00:13:54 Well, of course.
00:13:55 Arlo's done nothing wrong.
00:13:57 But it's just that Arlo can attract a younger audience because of the nature of his content.
00:14:03 Okay, but Arlo's not who we're talking about.
00:14:06 We're talking about Spider-Man and Elsa pregnancy videos.
00:14:09 Right, no, that's the problem.
00:14:11 But I'm just saying there's some crossover, right?
00:14:14 Maybe, but what's the what?
00:14:17 That's just saying that he's probably going to lose some money from this.
00:14:22 Presumably.
00:14:24 I mean, maybe, I guess, yeah.
00:14:26 But not because the law says he ought to, but because YouTube...
00:14:29 No, because YouTube's system has allowed this wrong thing to happen.
00:14:35 And there are people who ride the line like Arlo, who are probably making some extra money
00:14:39 because of that data collection those targeted ads to younger users.
00:14:42 Yeah, and I'm not saying he's at fault or anything.
00:14:46 It's just an unfortunate side effect of YouTube's continued lack of integrity.
00:14:53 Which is a long story history.
00:14:56 The thing is, is this lawyer thing with this third like middle ground option in the law
00:15:04 that says you're exempt if, basically says you're exempt if it's a general audience,
00:15:10 means that people like Arlo and MatPat should not be affected at all,
00:15:14 but they have no option to do the middle ground thing.
00:15:18 Yes, yes.
00:15:20 Which is annoying and shady and that sucks.
00:15:24 But I feel like generally this means that most people who are not Spider-Man Elsa will be okay.
00:15:30 And furthermore, getting to the point where the fines would go out,
00:15:35 it's going to be...
00:15:37 That is not going to be a YouTube...
00:15:41 YouTube might use bots and AI to flag the videos as infringing on kids, whatever.
00:15:48 Like it's kids, but it's not listed as for kids.
00:15:52 They've decided that it's for kids.
00:15:54 And then the FTC gets a list of these things and they go out and then they look at them with people
00:15:59 because they're going to have to make actual fines to actual people.
00:16:03 And they can't, it's going to be expensive if they lose.
00:16:07 Like if this goes to court and they lose because they trusted Google YouTube AI to tell them the truth.
00:16:14 They have to, they should.
00:16:17 Gabe, is this the video by the way?
00:16:19 I'm pretty sure that only YouTube itself and no, I don't think any individual creators are liable for anything.
00:16:27 No, but like the FTC, in the situation where there is a YouTuber who is profiting off of data collected from children,
00:16:37 the FTC has decided that the channel owner is liable for some reason.
00:16:42 Like I assume it's like part of the YouTube settlement, like YouTube passed the buck over.
00:16:48 We'll give you this money.
00:16:50 I don't think FTC decided that, I think YouTube decided that.
00:16:53 YouTube decided, yeah, it was like part of whatever happened.
00:16:56 I don't actually know having looked into that.
00:16:58 And it's basically like extra legal is the idea that either creators are responsible and should be the ones to report themselves.
00:17:08 If you are not targeting kids specifically, you'll be fine, I think.
00:17:15 Because the likelihood that you will actually get hit by a fine is so low if you have ground to stand on, which most people do.
00:17:26 I almost hope I get sued because then I'll get some of that sweet like GoFundMe internet drama money, you know,
00:17:32 and everyone will care about my channel and all those things will happen.
00:17:36 And I know I'll win. I know I will win if I'm sued for this.
00:17:39 Well, yeah, I mean the thing is you know you'll win, which is why you won't get sued because the FTC is the one who has to do the suing.
00:17:46 Unfortunately for me, that's the real discrimination. Maybe I want to get sued. That would be nice.
00:17:50 Good life experience right there.
00:17:53 I think the problem that started this entire thing, because like this is going through the traditional like YouTube drama life cycle of like
00:18:00 really fucking crazy fear mongering, everyone's terrified, radical changes, everyone with their hot takes,
00:18:06 and then all of a sudden like, oh, it's not that bad, you know, the typical way these things go.
00:18:11 But like the reason this one I think was like reacted to so harshly so quickly is that there's just like a video like of the head of the FTC,
00:18:19 like he did like some sort of like meeting about this and just straight up said,
00:18:22 That guy looks like a primo boomer.
00:18:24 Yeah, like the typical boomer of just being like, we're coming for you guys.
00:18:28 We have the technology. We're going to take down as many as possible.
00:18:33 He just wishes he was like in the CIA talking about terrorism, but he's not.
00:18:37 Instead of like everyone on YouTube imagining that this could possibly happen,
00:18:42 like the dude in charge was saying it was going to happen.
00:18:46 So it was kind of a weird thing to do, I guess, because it definitely alarmed a lot of myself.
00:18:53 Well, this is pretty fucked.
00:18:55 This is concerning for some people. I get it.
00:18:57 When any new thing appears to present, it's not actually new, but like when a new thing appears
00:19:01 and could potentially threaten your entire existence as like a creator, like I'm sure MatPat feels obviously that's scary.
00:19:07 But I feel like, I mean, maybe I've just been desensitized, but like how many of these fucking issues happen
00:19:13 that ultimately just peter out and like nothing important comes of them?
00:19:16 Well, I mean, MatPat's not fucking over anybody. He'll probably be fine.
00:19:20 I mean, there's, again, like really convinced that there is literally zero liability on any creator's account here,
00:19:28 and it's all YouTube or whatever.
00:19:30 I mean, I believe that, but it just seems, yeah.
00:19:35 I don't think anyone's going to be hurt.
00:19:37 I mean, there's going to be people who get their shit demonetized.
00:19:41 I was a little like worried at one point because, you know, my Give and Take channel has pony videos on them.
00:19:49 Not all of them are, some of them are analysis, and that's, you know, that's obvious.
00:19:53 Like, children aren't supposed to understand this sort of depth talking about fucking show.
00:19:58 Yeah, but I've seen a couple of documentaries that reveal that the true audience is adult men.
00:20:02 I think we all know that.
00:20:04 Have you heard about this My Little Pony thing?
00:20:08 It's not just for little girls anymore.
00:20:10 No, no, sir. No, no.
00:20:12 No, in fact, it is manly, and I'm a man, you see.
00:20:15 No, but like also, I've made those pony compilations earlier than that,
00:20:22 which are just like a series of clips from the show.
00:20:27 They've all been demonetized recently.
00:20:30 Some of them had survived up to this point, but then they finally got God by Hasbro.
00:20:35 But those are like, you could argue that those are just for kids.
00:20:40 I didn't intend for that.
00:20:43 It seems to me like Arlo-esque in that, incidentally, I could definitely see kids enjoying them,
00:20:48 but they're not specifically targeting kids.
00:20:50 But they're not like, I mean, they were specifically targeting bronies.
00:20:56 That's what my defense would be, and it's like, what's a bronie?
00:20:59 I'd have to explain that in court, like, oh my God, oh my God.
00:21:03 I've got a documentary to show you.
00:21:04 I've got a documentary to show you.
00:21:07 You know, my point before about how I suspect no one will be harmed.
00:21:11 So the one way that I think that might not be true is, okay, occasionally with YouTube,
00:21:16 things don't go exactly as they're intended to.
00:21:19 And this reminds me of how just recently, actually, like a few minutes before this very podcast began,
00:21:26 a new video was uploaded to one CGP Gray's channel, and I think I have it right here,
00:21:31 where CGP Gray was fucking locked out of his main channel for allegedly impersonating Dun Dun Dun himself,
00:21:40 is what YouTube thought was happening.
00:21:41 They were like, you're not CGP Gray.
00:21:43 You're like a spammer or like a bot account or something.
00:21:46 And he had to like fight to get it back.
00:21:49 And he won, which is why there's this new video and the other one, which is probably delayed,
00:21:53 until this issue was resolved.
00:21:54 It took him like over the weekend or something.
00:21:57 But so the issue is, things don't always work like exactly as they were supposed to.
00:22:02 Sometimes a couple of things fall through the cracks, and that's not so good.
00:22:06 And the algorithm ain't perfect.
00:22:08 I know, imagine that.
00:22:10 So in that sense, perhaps there are things to be at least like aware of and concerned is,
00:22:16 we're going to institute new restrictions, new demotization criteria,
00:22:21 and they don't have the best track record of applying that shit exactly where and when it should be.
00:22:26 So on that basis, perhaps it's a more urgent concern.
00:22:31 That's understandable.
00:22:32 The whole thing, I was wearing into like, at first I was like,
00:22:37 there's no way that people are actually going to get fines that big.
00:22:40 And then I looked into it and I was a little scared for a second.
00:22:42 Then I looked into it more and it was fine.
00:22:44 But I kind of wish, like deep down, I kind of wish that it was like the YouTube ending disaster
00:22:51 that is everyone on January 1st, everyone gets a million fines.
00:22:55 So they have to turn off all their channels and everyone leaves.
00:22:58 You guys are just in a black pill mode.
00:23:00 Just wants it all to burn.
00:23:02 I kind of would have, like it would have been the saving grace of the whole thing,
00:23:09 is the knowledge that YouTube is finally fucking killed.
00:23:12 Fuck you.
00:23:13 And you know what that reminds me?
00:23:14 The kind of the other point of CGPK's video was that like guys at any moment,
00:23:18 YouTube can ban us, can deal with, like this guy's got four million subscribers.
00:23:22 At any moment, YouTube can just decide arbitrarily,
00:23:25 they add more and more clauses when they can just decide
00:23:28 if they don't want you anymore and whatnot.
00:23:30 He's like, but you know what still fucking works?
00:23:32 Email lists, baby.
00:23:34 Email lists are the way to go to make sure.
00:23:37 I know you've got your email list, Gib.
00:23:40 I just now went to my monetization settings and I clicked it.
00:23:44 I never upload content for kids settings.
00:23:47 Woo!
00:23:48 Lives saved.
00:23:49 But Ben, you talked about Winnie the Pooh.
00:23:52 Well, not to you.
00:23:54 If you're 13 or under, you stupid jerk.
00:23:57 Get off my internet.
00:23:59 Boomers, rise up.
00:24:01 Imagine a future.
00:24:03 This is just some anti-zoomer propagandas that this is.
00:24:06 Yeah, that's true.
00:24:08 We Zoomers deserved have ads served to us, catered to our specific needs.
00:24:12 It's fucked up, but they'll take that away from us.
00:24:18 That's how we exist.
00:24:20 Yeah, well, good luck to everybody out there.
00:24:23 It's a jungle out there.
00:24:25 Everybody should make their own website and email list anyway,
00:24:28 because it's just better.
00:24:30 But the effort, ooh, the more than zero effort that requires.
00:24:34 Ooh, Ungabunga, Ungabunga.
00:24:37 Oh, man.
00:24:38 Think about my email.
00:24:39 Never, never, never.
00:24:41 Speaking of websites that I own,
00:24:44 which is my website, apsadventures.site,
00:24:49 the name sucks.
00:24:51 I've been trying to think of a better name for months, for years.
00:24:55 Gibbentake.com, Hippocrite.com.
00:24:58 I guess Gibbentake.com might do it.
00:25:01 It hurt to have both.
00:25:03 We did it, guys. We figured it out.
00:25:06 Fine, I guess that wasn't...
00:25:08 I'd say it's the most well-known branding name of you, perhaps,
00:25:12 except maybe Hippocrite, but slightly different thing there.
00:25:16 Yeah, the only thing I was thinking about with Gibbentake...
00:25:19 Did you buy content.com, which redirects to our YouTube,
00:25:22 for like 20 bucks for a year, so that, you know, not too expensive.
00:25:25 Oh, no, no, it's not the expense that I'm thinking of.
00:25:28 It's just like the name. I wanted a name.
00:25:30 20 bucks for a year, that's a fucking deal.
00:25:33 Yeah, I mean, how many people wanted...
00:25:35 It cost me like $10 a month.
00:25:37 How many people wanted can-tent, I guess, spelled fucked up.
00:25:41 Wait, no, no, wait, I'm paying for hosting,
00:25:45 so that's different.
00:25:47 Never mind.
00:25:49 I wanted something...
00:25:51 I was trying to think of something that was,
00:25:54 one, unique and interesting and cool and stuff.
00:25:58 Two, sort of explains what the hell it is before you click on it.
00:26:03 Like, St. Comics, okay, it's a comic website about angels, I guess,
00:26:08 you know, from the name.
00:26:10 A good Catholic website, thank God.
00:26:13 Yeah, and something that you couldn't actually misspell.
00:26:18 Like, if you heard someone say it, there would be no way you could misspell it.
00:26:22 Like, St. Comics, those are words.
00:26:25 You know how to spell those.
00:26:27 They're not comics with a CK and an X, as I recall, which was wise.
00:26:30 But fucking give and take, it's a pun, it's a play on words, it's give and take.
00:26:36 If you say that to someone, they're not immediately going to understand it's the monkey
00:26:40 and the act of taking something as a word.
00:26:44 So I was like, that might not be perfect.
00:26:47 I mean, phonetically, give and take.
00:26:49 I mean, people hear the joke, but I mean, the B's are very distinct.
00:26:52 I think it's a pretty decent one for recognizability of how to write it.
00:26:57 But then again, I've known you so long, maybe I'm a little biased in that.
00:27:01 Yeah, Hippocrates similarly, like, the whole joke, not the whole joke,
00:27:06 but part of the joke is that it's like how people often misspell Hippocrite.
00:27:11 Names are hard, guys.
00:27:16 Marketing and shmarketing.
00:27:18 I've been putting it off for a million years.
00:27:21 And also, I don't like the idea of like, porting over Bale-Japes in its entirety to a whole other website.
00:27:27 Or, you know, whatever I would need to do to change the name.
00:27:32 Couldn't you just copy the code?
00:27:35 Like, just copy paste the whole thing.
00:27:37 You're using Google Sites, right?
00:27:39 No, no, I'm using WordPress's thing.
00:27:43 Not free WordPress, the other one.
00:27:46 The real big boy WordPress.org?
00:27:49 The real WordPress, yes.
00:27:51 That's what the PCP website uses as well.
00:27:53 I've been uploading, so I've started uploading to Webtoon and Tapas.
00:27:59 I'm kind of pushing Webtoon more because I feel like the audience is bigger there.
00:28:03 But at some point, I'll put Slime and Punishment up on St. Comics, just like as an archive.
00:28:08 But I've been putting it on Webtoon just because I feel like, not a lot of people,
00:28:14 but like some people will see it there and like, you know...
00:28:18 Possibly the most dedicated fans, perhaps, if they're there?
00:28:21 Maybe.
00:28:22 Yeah, like, just because it's a public, it's like YouTube.
00:28:25 It's like YouTube for Web Comics.
00:28:27 And go visit my fucking site.
00:28:29 Go search Bansain on webtoons.com.
00:28:32 Subscribe, like all my shit.
00:28:34 It just passed a thousand likes on Slime and Punishment,
00:28:36 which means that now, when it's displayed, when you see a new update
00:28:40 on the little fucking new updates page, it doesn't just...
00:28:43 It actually tells you how...
00:28:45 It says like, this guy's actually got some fucking likes on his shit.
00:28:48 Oh, that's nice.
00:28:49 Like, oh yeah, I'm cool.
00:28:51 What's the... Is the currency devalued?
00:28:53 What's like a large number of likes or whatever to have on tabs?
00:28:56 I mean, if you're really big, you might have millions.
00:28:59 Okay, fair enough.
00:29:00 Fair enough.
00:29:01 Homestuck?
00:29:02 No.
00:29:03 Two likes.
00:29:04 Nobody likes.
00:29:05 No, like...
00:29:06 Zero likes and homestuck.
00:29:08 Or, um...
00:29:09 I don't know.
00:29:10 God, I wish that were me.
00:29:12 Yeah, I wish everyone was using Notify.me,
00:29:15 because it is the best thing in the world that nobody...
00:29:18 Explain that, Tom.
00:29:19 I don't understand.
00:29:20 Okay, so Notify.me is a website...
00:29:22 Is a website slash app slash service,
00:29:25 and what you do is you can make an account on Notify.me,
00:29:28 and you can plug in any source you want,
00:29:32 and people can subscribe to you on Notify.me,
00:29:35 and every time you upload anything anywhere,
00:29:38 it sends your subscribers a notification.
00:29:40 So instead of having to be like,
00:29:42 Oh, I have to be on YouTube,
00:29:44 because that's where everybody is.
00:29:46 If everybody just used Notify.me,
00:29:48 you could just post on your website,
00:29:50 a notification that you posted something on your website,
00:29:52 on their Notify app,
00:29:53 and then they could see it there.
00:29:55 Oh, so they have to download Notify.
00:29:57 Correct.
00:29:58 It's a platform specifically just to have notifications.
00:30:03 It's basically pulling the notifications out of an app,
00:30:06 out of individual apps,
00:30:08 like, oh, I gotta get my YouTube notifications
00:30:10 and my Twitter notifications.
00:30:11 It's putting them all in one thing.
00:30:13 So you get notifications of people, not of services.
00:30:16 I mean, I would love it if everything was kind of on there,
00:30:19 and it kind of reminds me a little bit of, like,
00:30:21 Dick's Masterson made New Project 2,
00:30:23 which is just Patreon with no...
00:30:26 It actually takes zero fees from what I understand,
00:30:29 so it actually would be preferable.
00:30:31 It takes a small transaction fee for the bank.
00:30:33 For bank fees.
00:30:34 I mean, yeah, that's understandable,
00:30:36 but I mean, Patreon takes, I believe, a 5% cut.
00:30:38 Slightly more, if I remember.
00:30:40 I think it's like 9%.
00:30:42 Is it? I haven't checked in a while.
00:30:44 90%.
00:30:45 No, maybe it's not 9%.
00:30:46 I know they changed their terms.
00:30:47 I think it used to be 5, and then they changed their terms.
00:30:49 But, like, we have an old Patreon,
00:30:51 so it got grandfathered into the, like,
00:30:53 we keep the 5% or something.
00:30:55 I don't fucking know.
00:30:56 But, like, that...
00:30:58 Patreon has all these facsimiles of, like,
00:31:01 vestigial social media stuff
00:31:04 that doesn't matter, and who cares,
00:31:07 and I just want a bank transaction on a place
00:31:09 that won't kick me off,
00:31:11 which I am not convinced Patreon will never do to us,
00:31:14 or any of us individually.
00:31:16 So just a neutral platform
00:31:18 that just does nothing would be nice.
00:31:20 Yeah, like one of these generic...
00:31:22 As generic as possible, please.
00:31:24 No coming down on any side of any issue.
00:31:28 Just transact.
00:31:30 That would be my preference, but...
00:31:32 Hey, what you gonna do?
00:31:34 I mean, I love minimalist,
00:31:38 like, no bells and whistles,
00:31:40 no distraction bullshit on websites,
00:31:42 which is why most social media websites are annoying.
00:31:45 They've always got things they want you to look at,
00:31:48 and advertisements, and clickity-clackity things
00:31:51 all over the place.
00:31:53 And then every normal website
00:31:55 that is owned by some company has, you know,
00:31:57 100,000 things you have to click on
00:31:59 before you can see anything,
00:32:01 and then you also have to turn your ad blocker off,
00:32:03 and it's just, like, this is unsatisfying.
00:32:05 I hate the internet. It's not good anymore.
00:32:08 I just want a blank page with text on it that I can read.
00:32:11 You know, I think that this kind of, I don't know,
00:32:14 this, like, social media-esque bubble,
00:32:17 I think it will eventually burst,
00:32:19 and I think that we will see a return
00:32:21 to rote functionality one day,
00:32:25 where people will be like, it's just a basic shit.
00:32:27 I don't think it will ever return to anything.
00:32:31 I think what's gonna happen is that the social media bubble
00:32:34 is going to become an entirely normie thing,
00:32:36 and then everyone who's cool
00:32:38 will be not doing it anymore.
00:32:42 Like, they'll have to log on to Twitter for work.
00:32:45 Yeah.
00:32:47 God, I can't wait for the, what is it,
00:32:49 the social credit score.
00:32:51 Please, I want my tweets to be evaluated
00:32:53 for their affiliation to the one-party system
00:32:56 that we have. Oh, God, please.
00:32:58 I want to rake up the points.
00:33:00 Imagine if we made social, oh, God,
00:33:02 my peach fucking amiibo just fell,
00:33:06 but that's all right.
00:33:07 Speaking of social credit,
00:33:10 what was I fucking saying?
00:33:12 I want to gamify political ranking in the country
00:33:16 because I will then win.
00:33:18 I will then get the high score.
00:33:20 But right now, it's just some bullshit about it.
00:33:22 Wait, gamify in what way?
00:33:24 What would you suggest?
00:33:25 If there's a number value attached
00:33:27 to how many things I'm allowed to do socially,
00:33:30 like in China, if you do certain things
00:33:32 and you have a loan of social credit score,
00:33:34 I could be off about this, but as I understood it,
00:33:37 you can't take the train
00:33:39 to travel between cities or something.
00:33:41 You just aren't allowed to do that.
00:33:43 And I don't know what mechanisms you have to change it.
00:33:46 Maybe you can go give yourself 100 lashes
00:33:48 or go right on the chalkboard.
00:33:50 I believe in the state,
00:33:52 something like that over and over.
00:33:54 I want that. I'll be in there every day,
00:33:56 scribbling on my chalkboard.
00:33:57 You can go kill Hong Kong protesters
00:33:59 and you get points for everyone you take down.
00:34:02 Headshots count for extra 50 points.
00:34:06 Oh, my God, this is it.
00:34:07 It's like death race.
00:34:09 I was going to say, they let you log into a video game,
00:34:12 but it's like a drone control video game
00:34:15 and you log in to go mow down Hong Kong protesters
00:34:18 to up your credit score.
00:34:19 Now, that's the kind of shit I'm talking about.
00:34:21 It's like that thing in standalone complex, I think.
00:34:25 I think I saw a Digi video where they made a video game
00:34:29 and it controls a robot that goes and kills people
00:34:32 and the kids don't realize that's what's happening.
00:34:34 I don't remember that in standalone comics.
00:34:37 Wait, was it Psycho Pass Season 2?
00:34:40 It was something bad.
00:34:42 I would guess that Psycho Pass.
00:34:43 Yeah, that is Psycho Pass.
00:34:45 That's funny because I was totally afraid.
00:34:47 I was almost revealed as a ghost on the shelf fraud just now.
00:34:50 That was a close one.
00:34:52 I've never seen that fucking show.
00:34:54 I only know it because of Digi talking about that show,
00:34:56 but I thought I had seen it.
00:34:58 I was like, oh yeah, that was totally standalone complex.
00:35:00 I remember the whole thing.
00:35:02 The thing is, Nate, if this comes to pass
00:35:05 and it will be just like anything else
00:35:07 YouTube slash the internet does,
00:35:09 where the rules will be an algorithm
00:35:11 and we will not know what it is.
00:35:13 So we'll have to reverse engineer how the fuck
00:35:15 we even got our social credit score
00:35:17 and how to make it better and it'll be a nightmare.
00:35:20 It reminds me of how Matt Pat was so convinced early on
00:35:24 because Matt Pat originally came to YouTube
00:35:26 from like he worked for an MSM
00:35:28 or whatever the fuck they're called
00:35:30 streaming, so he felt he had an understanding
00:35:32 of how things were going to work.
00:35:34 He made a video once about how he was convinced
00:35:37 PewDiePie had gotten so popular,
00:35:39 but PewDiePie has many times come out
00:35:41 and been like, this is complete bullshit
00:35:43 and is not true.
00:35:45 I forget exactly why he was convinced of that,
00:35:47 but I remember thinking that seemed reasonable.
00:35:50 So I don't know which of those two guys are right,
00:35:52 but they definitely don't agree
00:35:54 and one of them's got to be kind of right
00:35:56 more than the other, I'd assume.
00:35:59 Matt Pat talked about how PewDiePie was saying
00:36:02 that it was bullshit and he said,
00:36:04 you know, I did get some things wrong.
00:36:06 I'm not interested in the drama,
00:36:08 but on this point of order, as Tom's saying,
00:36:11 we have to kind of figure out how the systems work
00:36:14 because we are not told deliberately so.
00:36:16 They want to keep things mysterious,
00:36:18 maybe for the illusion of naturality
00:36:21 in the system or something.
00:36:23 I think it's just because if everyone knows
00:36:25 how the algorithm works,
00:36:27 everyone will just game it instead of like,
00:36:29 just make content.
00:36:31 There's this back and forth of just like,
00:36:33 you want to have a platform
00:36:35 that is serving the user,
00:36:37 but without being so transparent
00:36:39 that it's completely
00:36:41 disincentivizing natural content creation.
00:36:44 It's that everyone's just trying to game the system
00:36:46 because then the system is limiting expression
00:36:49 and not helping it, you know?
00:36:51 It's occurred to me recently on that front.
00:36:53 I have just continued making videos
00:36:55 and I recognize about this myself.
00:36:57 I've just basically assumed
00:36:59 that like, if I just keep doing it,
00:37:01 things will work out reasonably well.
00:37:03 Like, I'm probably not being suppressed
00:37:05 in unfortunate ways.
00:37:07 I'm probably not like, totally wasting my time.
00:37:10 It'll probably work out, right?
00:37:12 I don't know that that's true,
00:37:14 but that's how I'm operating.
00:37:16 And I'm aware that like,
00:37:18 continuing to operate is basically assuming
00:37:20 that that is the case.
00:37:22 So like, I have culpability
00:37:24 in that I'm choosing to believe that, basically.
00:37:26 And it may not be true.
00:37:28 I may be making horrible mistakes
00:37:30 and wasting my time day in and day out,
00:37:32 but well, I guess I'll learn that one of these days,
00:37:34 maybe when I'm dead.
00:37:36 And God tells me so.
00:37:38 It's strange in particular,
00:37:40 your channel and its growth
00:37:42 has always, I guess, kind of confused me
00:37:44 because like, the meme has always been,
00:37:47 and we've mentioned it on this show before,
00:37:49 like once you hit 100k,
00:37:51 you get that extra boost.
00:37:53 I'm hoping for that to happen.
00:37:55 And that like, didn't happen for your channel for some reason?
00:37:57 I completely flatlined it, 100,000 basically.
00:37:59 And I don't understand why that is happening,
00:38:01 because it's not like you've stopped making content.
00:38:03 Like, oh, I hit 100k, time to hang up my hat.
00:38:05 You know, it's been very interesting
00:38:07 for me to look at the,
00:38:09 and maybe the videos are just worse,
00:38:11 that's definitely possible,
00:38:13 but like, for a time,
00:38:15 we were getting like, I don't know,
00:38:17 like easily between 30,000 to 50,000,
00:38:19 even over like 100,000 views,
00:38:21 and they're like, relatively lucky to clear 20,000.
00:38:23 And I just wonder,
00:38:25 is it just me, or did something change?
00:38:27 I mean, I'd be happy to
00:38:29 accept responsibility,
00:38:31 if I'm just making a worse product,
00:38:33 that's definitely possible,
00:38:35 but it doesn't seem like that.
00:38:37 I think it would be a mixture,
00:38:39 because I felt like,
00:38:41 your more recent wee aguas in the past
00:38:43 like, few months have been,
00:38:45 you know, like, they're alright.
00:38:47 They feel a little bloated
00:38:49 of talking going on in them,
00:38:51 especially like, the front-loading
00:38:53 upload, like, you talk about
00:38:55 what the thing is for a long time,
00:38:57 and then get to the interesting part,
00:38:59 like, near the middle and the end.
00:39:01 It's just that I don't feel that that's changed much
00:39:03 from how they used to be,
00:39:05 and I mean, that's the curious thing to me.
00:39:07 I'm aware, I'm happy to take any criticisms,
00:39:09 and you know...
00:39:11 I mean, that's just my, like, the back of my head,
00:39:13 like, what am I thinking?
00:39:15 Like, why was I happy about
00:39:17 just sort of, eh, I don't really understand.
00:39:19 Well, you know, I have one other theory that relates to that,
00:39:21 which is just that the format has gotten
00:39:23 stale, kind of in general,
00:39:25 and that could explain it. Like, at first,
00:39:27 maybe the videos were better, maybe they weren't,
00:39:29 they were shorter when they first started,
00:39:31 but now people, like, one, they're bloated,
00:39:33 and two, maybe people are simply like,
00:39:35 eh, I get it, Nate talks about thing, whatever,
00:39:37 which is, you know, again, that could totally be
00:39:39 fair. We're all just still waiting
00:39:41 for the second video of Nate's channel,
00:39:43 Best Anime Ever Goes On The Shell.
00:39:45 It will happen someday. I'm sure
00:39:47 Nate will make a new video eventually.
00:39:49 It's only been, like, two years.
00:39:51 One of these days, one of these days,
00:39:53 we'll see a video from Nate.
00:39:55 Why is he leaving us hanging? He doesn't make any videos.
00:39:57 Oof. I'm doing my best, boys.
00:39:59 One day.
00:40:01 Hey, uh, incidentally, left turn,
00:40:03 I've got an anecdote that I think
00:40:05 you lads will find amusing,
00:40:07 enjoyable, uh, perhaps
00:40:09 hilarious.
00:40:11 Uh, let's, let's, let's, let's see what you think.
00:40:13 So, the other day, I was going to
00:40:15 the P.O. box to pick up my mail
00:40:17 for We Aguas, as it happens,
00:40:19 and I went and got my, got my couple of packages,
00:40:21 and I forget why.
00:40:23 There was, like, an issue with one or something.
00:40:25 Oh, I had to actually, I was paying for a renewal
00:40:27 to my, uh, P.O. box,
00:40:29 because it was, it was running out. Got to get six more months, whatever.
00:40:31 So, I had to go up to the counter to do this,
00:40:33 and so, me and, and Michelle happens to be with me,
00:40:35 because we were, she was driving somewhere, whatever.
00:40:37 And she's wearing her big bear coat.
00:40:39 It's like, uh, she gets compliments on it all the time.
00:40:41 It's, it's cute, it's furry, it's got a big bear face.
00:40:43 It's, uh, everybody loves it.
00:40:45 Right? And she's actually, actually one time
00:40:47 we were in the airport, and
00:40:49 a woman just walked up and said,
00:40:51 hey, excuse me, I love your coat.
00:40:53 Can I just buy it off you?
00:40:55 And Michelle said, I mean, you know,
00:40:57 I'm a kind of cold, and the woman was like,
00:40:59 I'll give you my coat, and I'll pay you for it.
00:41:01 It seemed like a, a well-off individual.
00:41:03 How good is this coat? I haven't seen this.
00:41:05 This really happened. I think she was only willing
00:41:07 to go up to, like, 50 bucks
00:41:09 and she would also trade her coat.
00:41:11 Which is, it's not like this coat is, like,
00:41:13 so, like, valuable,
00:41:15 it just is cute, and I think on a whim
00:41:17 people like it. And she gets compliments all the time.
00:41:19 So, in this case.
00:41:21 If you want to, you want to make a proposition like that,
00:41:23 you gotta have more money to throw around than 50 bucks.
00:41:25 To buy the coat off their back, I mean, yeah,
00:41:27 for sure. We're talking, we're talking, like,
00:41:29 like, 50K, maybe.
00:41:31 I mean, Michelle skinned
00:41:33 this bear herself. She wrestled it,
00:41:35 she defeated it in combat, you know,
00:41:37 it was at least $75.
00:41:41 I'd say so.
00:41:43 So, Michelle's, whatever,
00:41:45 she's wearing this coat, we walk into the counter,
00:41:47 and I'm buying the renewal for the P.O. Box.
00:41:49 And the lady, it's like this nice black lady
00:41:51 I see all the time. She, she just says to us,
00:41:53 she's like, oh, you know, hey, nice to see you again.
00:41:55 I'm like, hey, what's going on? She's like, oh, I,
00:41:57 I love your coat, she says to Michelle.
00:41:59 And she's like, oh, thank you, thank you,
00:42:01 getting one of these compliments. And she's like,
00:42:03 you know what that reminds me of?
00:42:05 My son's, like, my son has.
00:42:07 And we're like, okay, that's interesting.
00:42:09 She's like, yeah, you know,
00:42:11 except his doesn't have the face on it
00:42:13 in that same spot, she had, like, the hood back.
00:42:15 He's like, yeah, his has, like, a tail on it
00:42:17 instead.
00:42:19 Interesting, interesting.
00:42:21 And then she's like, yeah, you know,
00:42:23 he was wearing it at this thing called,
00:42:25 I swear to God, this is true,
00:42:27 Anthrocon, or like, something like that.
00:42:29 And I mean, we're just,
00:42:31 we're just looking at each other.
00:42:33 And we are thinking to ourselves, oh,
00:42:35 oh no. And you know Michelle,
00:42:37 Michelle hates the furries.
00:42:39 She wants the full genocide of the
00:42:41 furries. So Michelle
00:42:43 is not pleased
00:42:45 to be compared to an Anthrocon.
00:42:47 So this whole time, maybe that lady who came
00:42:49 up to buy it was like a furry
00:42:51 and they were looking for that sort of coat.
00:42:53 She was on her way to Anthrocon and she needed
00:42:55 a costume, she forgot hers at home.
00:42:57 So like, as we're leaving, she's like,
00:42:59 yeah, you know, it looks great on you,
00:43:01 but you know, I don't know about my sons,
00:43:03 like it's a little weird for like a 30-year-old man
00:43:05 to be wearing a fuzzy bear outfit,
00:43:07 but hey, he's my son, so I love him.
00:43:09 And we're like, thank you, ma'am,
00:43:11 thank you, ma'am, for this information.
00:43:13 Have a wonderful day. And we
00:43:15 turned 360 degrees and walked out.
00:43:17 And so Michelle
00:43:19 was just reeling from the realization
00:43:21 that maybe Michelle
00:43:23 Tobin is a little closer to the furry
00:43:25 community than she would like to believe.
00:43:27 You know, she's real cozy with Cassie
00:43:29 and she's seeing some red flags
00:43:31 trying to recover from the mental trauma.
00:43:33 So this coat has like a
00:43:35 bare head?
00:43:37 I will have to get a picture and put it in the show notes,
00:43:39 but it's just like a tan
00:43:41 furry-looking coat
00:43:43 and the hood that you can put up over your face
00:43:45 just as kind of like a cutesy sort of
00:43:47 Japanese-looking bear face
00:43:49 on the hood. Is it like the end of Midsommar?
00:43:55 Yes, identical to the ending of Midsommar.
00:43:57 I just watched Midsommar
00:43:59 yesterday or two days ago
00:44:01 because I was supposed to discuss it with
00:44:03 Mumki and Florian on Is It Kino?
00:44:05 And then Mumki just... No, Mumki
00:44:07 just like, he's just like
00:44:09 too busy. I didn't
00:44:11 like one day before
00:44:13 we're supposed to do it,
00:44:15 he just puts in our group chat
00:44:17 like, eh, you know,
00:44:19 I don't have the time to do Is It Kino
00:44:21 or watch any of the movies.
00:44:23 Well, at least he gave you a day warning, I guess,
00:44:25 but still an unfortunate. Well, yeah, the day before.
00:44:27 I had already gone
00:44:29 and watched, like, all the shit.
00:44:31 Was there more than one?
00:44:33 Yeah, there was.
00:44:35 Because I said, I wanted... Mumki, Mumki.
00:44:37 He was like, pick a
00:44:39 pick a thing, pick like an underrated movie
00:44:41 you want to talk about. And I was like,
00:44:43 Turbo Kid, 100%
00:44:45 Turbo Kid. Oh, right, right, yeah, yeah.
00:44:47 And they were like, okay, cool, we'll watch
00:44:49 Turbo Kid. And then, like, later on
00:44:51 in the week, Florian is like
00:44:53 he's like, hey, have you seen
00:44:55 some movie? It was like some
00:44:57 new movie with Christian Bale. And I'm like,
00:44:59 no? And he's like, we're going to talk about that too.
00:45:01 And I'm like, I gotta
00:45:03 go to the theater and watch a movie?
00:45:05 I thought we paid him money too.
00:45:07 Well, I didn't. I skipped out.
00:45:09 And then I was like, and then he's like, okay,
00:45:11 we're also going to talk about the New Rick and Morty
00:45:13 and Midsommar. And I'm like, oh, Jesus Christ.
00:45:15 A lot of things, a lot of things.
00:45:17 I don't want to do any of those, but I did.
00:45:19 I did watch the New Rick and Morty
00:45:21 and I did watch Midsommar just for this.
00:45:23 I didn't get to watch whatever this Christian Bale
00:45:25 film is. And I don't really want to,
00:45:27 but whatever.
00:45:29 Yeah. And then it gets
00:45:31 fucking postponed indefinitely
00:45:33 on my ass.
00:45:35 I can't believe you would come out here
00:45:37 and make a straight-up drama video
00:45:39 against one, Monkey Jones.
00:45:41 It's never been done before, as I understand it.
00:45:43 And you are breaking new ground here
00:45:45 by exposing him as the hack-fraud
00:45:47 canceler of plans. A real Indian giver
00:45:49 of, you know. That full little baby
00:45:51 needs all the defense he can get.
00:45:53 Mmm.
00:45:55 I'm just the guy to give it.
00:45:57 Well, I made that just the way.
00:45:59 Well, I was until now.
00:46:01 I really would have wanted to watch that, though.
00:46:03 I've never seen it. I've never seen
00:46:05 Izakino. It's just never been a thing
00:46:07 I wanted to look at. No. Oh, I watched,
00:46:09 I remember feeling, I was, I will
00:46:11 stent me and Asperger are like
00:46:13 bosom buddies over our love
00:46:15 of law-abiding citizens
00:46:17 starring Russell Crowe.
00:46:19 Yeah, Russell Crowe. Is that true?
00:46:21 Absolutely. Absolutely.
00:46:23 Okay. I mean, we never
00:46:25 spoke about it, but he did love that movie
00:46:27 and I also love that movie.
00:46:29 I have never seen law-abiding citizens.
00:46:31 It's based.
00:46:33 Okay. All right. Pretty epic.
00:46:35 That's all there is to it, Ben. It's frankly, it's based.
00:46:37 Okay. Well, I mean, you can't
00:46:39 argue with quality. You know, I mean, it's about
00:46:41 a man. It's about a man going to any
00:46:43 lengths to get revenge for his
00:46:45 significant other, his wife in this case,
00:46:47 being, let's just say,
00:46:49 manhandled a bit negatively, and we all
00:46:51 know how Asperger feels about those things.
00:46:53 He won't have that. Oh boy.
00:46:55 Yeah, okay.
00:46:57 Let's, let's, okay.
00:46:59 Okay.
00:47:01 Nobody knows what you're talking about.
00:47:03 That'll never get old. Should we cut this
00:47:05 part? No, why? That's fine.
00:47:07 I mean, is it not okay to make jokes
00:47:09 about a man who actually, you know,
00:47:11 laid his hands upon another?
00:47:13 It's kind of, all right. All right. Let's move
00:47:15 on. Okay. All right. I'm uncomfortable.
00:47:17 But it's pretty funny.
00:47:19 I'm very comfortable. But anyway. Okay, cool.
00:47:21 That's, did I have another thing? Oh,
00:47:23 you know what? Small baby little anecdote
00:47:25 here. I was just driving to pick up Michelle
00:47:27 from work, and on an overpass I
00:47:29 drove under. Simply the words.
00:47:31 Now, it's just, it's rare for me to see
00:47:33 what, to me, was basically a meme,
00:47:35 but this made it more real in my mind.
00:47:37 Just on this overpass was spray
00:47:39 painted the words, you know, in Cincinnati, Ohio,
00:47:41 out here in the Midwest doing bullshit.
00:47:43 Just the words, Epstein didn't kill himself.
00:47:45 Written on a bridge
00:47:47 in real life. Good, good for that.
00:47:49 Like everyone we've seen. Good for that bridge.
00:47:51 Good job. It's, you know, I mean,
00:47:53 it just makes me reflect on how, like,
00:47:55 oh, this isn't just funny internet memes.
00:47:57 This is things that, like, kind of the real world
00:47:59 probably gives a shit about, which
00:48:01 is totally fair.
00:48:03 Oopsie-doopsy. There we go again.
00:48:05 I found myself, like, I was listening
00:48:07 to the news in the background, and
00:48:09 they were saying something about, there was, like,
00:48:11 Prince Andrew,
00:48:13 son of Prince, not son,
00:48:15 a brother to Prince Charles,
00:48:17 the least, the less
00:48:19 cool Prince
00:48:21 son of the Queen. I thought he was the Queen's favorite, though.
00:48:23 I heard he was her favorite. I don't know if I can read it.
00:48:25 I've never fucking heard of this guy. Prince Charles
00:48:27 is always in the news. Prince Andrew is not.
00:48:29 Prince Andrew has, like,
00:48:31 like,
00:48:33 like a suspiciously close
00:48:35 friendship with Jeffrey Epstein,
00:48:37 and there was an interview where he was
00:48:39 talking about stuff, and he was like,
00:48:41 huh, what's going on?
00:48:43 That was a rough one.
00:48:45 But anyway, they were talking about Jeffrey Epstein
00:48:47 on the news, and they were saying
00:48:49 Epstein, who hung himself in his
00:48:51 Prince style. Oh, come on now, guys.
00:48:53 And I just, like, it was
00:48:55 an unconscious reaction. I was like, no, he didn't.
00:48:57 Like, I just said that.
00:48:59 No, he didn't. Like, it wasn't a meme.
00:49:01 I wasn't trying to be funny. It was like, oh, yeah,
00:49:03 I guess it's true.
00:49:05 I said it without thinking about it.
00:49:07 Oh, you know what I heard about? I heard that
00:49:09 one Steven Crowder, who I'm sure everybody here
00:49:11 loves intensely, is going
00:49:13 to do a show where he's going
00:49:15 to attempt to snap his own
00:49:17 spine in the ways
00:49:19 that it's been reported that Epstein
00:49:21 did, and I don't know,
00:49:23 he says he's doing a live stream or something. He's going to put, like,
00:49:25 a gauge around his neck
00:49:27 and attempt to gauge
00:49:29 how much force is being applied as he, like,
00:49:31 you know, ties himself up and, like, jumps
00:49:33 off a bunk bed that, like, they've constructed
00:49:35 for this. This sounds like a
00:49:37 liberal's wet dream, because, like, on the one
00:49:39 hand, you can either prove that Epstein didn't kill
00:49:41 himself, or Steven Crowder
00:49:43 will die. We could all get
00:49:45 behind this one.
00:49:47 Hmm.
00:49:49 I'm coming around. You know, it does
00:49:51 make me feel warm to see
00:49:53 how everybody is on this
00:49:55 bullshit about how Epstein definitely
00:49:57 didn't. I mean, Epstein just committing
00:49:59 suicide. Woopsie-doopsie is not the full
00:50:01 story. We're all, we're all
00:50:03 seeing it right now. We should cross the aisle and be
00:50:05 bipartisan and just run the corpse of
00:50:07 Jeffrey Epstein for president in 2020.
00:50:09 The one man you can trust
00:50:11 to not kill himself
00:50:13 in office. It's, I mean,
00:50:15 it's still sort of sad, though. Like, it's a
00:50:17 meme, and it can be spread as a
00:50:19 meme, and people can say it and spray paint it
00:50:21 everywhere, but, like,
00:50:23 nobody actually has any information on who
00:50:25 did cover it up. They did
00:50:27 their job correctly. Nobody has any leads.
00:50:29 You didn't kill himself, and we can't
00:50:31 prove who it was. And I'll happily
00:50:33 say, as I always do, like, it is
00:50:35 fear. I think there are conspiracies,
00:50:37 like, I don't know, like, there are versions
00:50:39 of the tale where Epstein was, like,
00:50:41 pressured or convinced to
00:50:43 in some ways, like, kill himself
00:50:45 in some ways.
00:50:47 Kill himself. I mean, I guess
00:50:49 I know what you mean. There are
00:50:51 things that, there are levers that can be pulled to make
00:50:53 someone commit suicide because, like, worse things
00:50:55 will be done to, I don't know, people they love
00:50:57 or they're, like, things like that.
00:50:59 I'm pretty sure if you're forced
00:51:01 to kill yourself, it's not actually suicide
00:51:03 anymore.
00:51:05 You know, that's, legally speaking, you might be right.
00:51:07 You might be right. But,
00:51:09 like, it's just,
00:51:11 I'm just so
00:51:13 disappointed by the
00:51:15 lack of, what's the word,
00:51:17 credulity, or incredulity
00:51:19 by, you know, many people
00:51:21 who just report it as fact. Like, yeah,
00:51:23 it definitely killed himself. I mean, the mainstream
00:51:25 media is obviously just going to step in line
00:51:27 and say what they need to say, and
00:51:29 there's no chance of it. What do they even gain?
00:51:31 But everyone is, like,
00:51:33 this is, we don't believe you.
00:51:35 Well, that's the thing. That's the thing is, like,
00:51:37 the people who orchestrated
00:51:39 his murder,
00:51:41 and who can manipulate the media
00:51:43 into saying for sure that, you know,
00:51:45 not even trying to look into it, like, you can't
00:51:47 report on, you can't, any of your journalists
00:51:49 who want to go nosing around, tell them to stop.
00:51:51 Experiency theorists, madmen,
00:51:53 like, somebody or some group of people
00:51:55 just have the power to do that, and that's
00:51:57 sucks.
00:51:59 I mean, we just, we need our
00:52:01 boy, we need our lord and savior, Alex Jones,
00:52:03 to get involved and really start
00:52:05 getting to the bottom of this mystery.
00:52:07 I want to see
00:52:09 Alex Jones snapping necks and be like, no, it required
00:52:11 more force than it took to do Epstein.
00:52:13 Let me tell you,
00:52:15 have you guys seen that wonderful image of him
00:52:17 on, like, his male vitality
00:52:19 supplement or whatever, where it's before and after
00:52:21 him, with his, like, you know, fat
00:52:23 man, what's the word, like, dad bod,
00:52:25 and then, like, after one month,
00:52:27 and after one month of using it, it's
00:52:29 just him, he looks exactly the same,
00:52:31 but significantly redder.
00:52:33 Like, his whole body
00:52:35 is just glowing with
00:52:37 male vitality.
00:52:39 And he tells that.
00:52:41 I love all those
00:52:43 memes where it's that video
00:52:45 of him, like, pointing someone like, hey, you.
00:52:47 It's like a Pokemon using overheat or something like that.
00:52:49 I love
00:52:51 all those memes where it's, like, the video of
00:52:53 him, like, pointing at someone's like, hey,
00:52:55 you, fuck you, and he starts running towards
00:52:57 them, but it's like, come out and put on
00:52:59 game footage.
00:53:01 Like, there was a Minecraft one where a creeper blew him up.
00:53:03 Yeah, I've seen that one.
00:53:05 Or actually, you know, a better comparison is, like,
00:53:07 it's like Regigigas with, like, slow
00:53:09 start, where for three turns
00:53:11 he's just a normal mortal man, but on
00:53:13 turn four, he's at full capacity
00:53:15 and he's sprinting at you as
00:53:17 Regigigas.
00:53:19 Oh my god, here comes the super
00:53:21 Alex Jones.
00:53:23 I love Pokemon. Let's talk about Pokemon.
00:53:25 That's a great idea.
00:53:27 We can talk about Pokemon and politics through the lens
00:53:29 of Alex Jones.
00:53:31 It all comes together.
00:53:33 Oof, beat the game.
00:53:35 It was good. I had a fun time.
00:53:37 No, no, it was a joke, Nate. We don't actually
00:53:39 know about Pokemon.
00:53:41 Go watch the new content episode, Me and Did You
00:53:43 Produced, where we go into it at length
00:53:45 in a, what's the word, separate but equal
00:53:47 podcast to the PCP.
00:53:49 Just for Pokemon discussion.
00:53:51 Oh, yeah, speaking of.
00:53:53 We have three-fifths of a podcast, I'd say.
00:53:55 You're going to do new Rickstee Minutes?
00:53:57 Oh, that's the next one coming up. Yep, we're definitely
00:53:59 doing new Rickstee Minutes.
00:54:01 Cool. Has there been another Rick and Woody since
00:54:03 the first one came out?
00:54:05 I think three episodes are out now, I believe.
00:54:07 At least two.
00:54:09 I'll give you the short version on episode one,
00:54:11 which is the one I've seen so far.
00:54:13 It was good, bordering on great,
00:54:15 but not amazing.
00:54:17 And I'm looking forward to see if it gets
00:54:19 better or worse or, I don't know.
00:54:21 Well, what to say? I liked it.
00:54:23 It was fun. Yeah, that was good.
00:54:25 It was fun and it was still Rick and Woody, so.
00:54:27 It was. I was not majorly disappointed at all.
00:54:29 Fuck yeah.
00:54:31 Fuck yeah.
00:54:33 I saw premiere and I saw episode two
00:54:35 and I thought the second episode was
00:54:37 pretty mediocre, but the premiere was
00:54:39 pretty good. That's the opposite
00:54:41 of what I was hoping for. I was hoping it would
00:54:43 ramp up as it keeps going.
00:54:45 I've watched any of them. I've just been watching
00:54:47 Beastars and The Mandalorian, which are both
00:54:49 fucking sick.
00:54:51 Oh shit, have you got
00:54:52 Didney Plurps? No, I have
00:54:54 the Leetx.to,
00:54:56 my favorite streaming service.
00:54:58 Everything's there. Leetx?
00:55:00 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Leetx.to.
00:55:02 You guys heard about Leetx.to?
00:55:04 Is that legal? Is that legal?
00:55:06 Monkey showed me this app and maybe I shouldn't
00:55:08 talk about it publicly, but here I am.
00:55:10 It's called TTV
00:55:12 and it just gets everything.
00:55:14 That sounds good.
00:55:16 I couldn't find any
00:55:18 rips of Rick and Morty
00:55:20 through Googling
00:55:22 and I'm like, hey monkey, where do I see it?
00:55:24 And he tells me about this app called
00:55:26 tea.tv
00:55:28 and I just get on there and I type
00:55:30 in Rick and Morty season four
00:55:32 and in zero time
00:55:34 there's like, you know, 50 different
00:55:36 file versions of the
00:55:38 new episodes
00:55:40 and he just finds
00:55:42 anything on there for free.
00:55:44 Do you have to torrent him or are they streaming there?
00:55:46 Well, I downloaded it to my phone.
00:55:48 They were streaming but I downloaded it
00:55:50 because it was, you know,
00:55:52 the phone wouldn't sputter or lag or anything
00:55:54 and so I don't know.
00:55:56 That seems pretty cool.
00:55:58 Seems like it worked
00:56:00 as intended.
00:56:02 Fuck the police.
00:56:04 Hear that knock on your door?
00:56:06 That's the police. They're listening
00:56:08 to this podcast right now. They're coming for you.
00:56:10 Oh, you know, the other day
00:56:12 I made a bit of a cheeky tweet
00:56:14 as
00:56:16 like it was a Nintendo put out
00:56:18 a tweet that was like, hey
00:56:20 it's like the 15 year anniversary
00:56:22 of the Nintendo DS.
00:56:24 Name some of your favorite games
00:56:26 and I as an epic meme lord
00:56:28 tweeted out, like I retweeted
00:56:30 that and said, what was it, like
00:56:32 the homebrew channel.
00:56:34 It was an excellent game. Really had a lot of fun
00:56:36 with that one or something.
00:56:38 And full disc, I think actually
00:56:40 I think Keyblade's spirit, that mother fucker
00:56:42 said like, wasn't it actually on the 3DS
00:56:44 the homebrew channel? But you know what the fuck I mean
00:56:46 my R4 card, my Ace card 2Y
00:56:48 I almost said it but I was like
00:56:50 don't let it get out of your skin, Nate.
00:56:52 I won't, damn you Keyblade. Now I'm mad.
00:56:54 Don't play on my DS.
00:56:56 I won't immediately
00:56:58 let you get out of your skin.
00:57:00 Two multiplayer.
00:57:02 I mean I played, I emulated a bunch of stuff
00:57:04 I played a million games
00:57:06 I think I actually played
00:57:08 ironically, I played Mother 3
00:57:10 on my PSP
00:57:12 emulating it on there instead.
00:57:14 But it was a wonderful time and it was a great
00:57:16 PSP was a great concept. They had a great
00:57:18 art app for the DS on DS Homebrew
00:57:20 called Colors. And it was crazy
00:57:22 because the screen on the DS
00:57:24 has pressure sensitivity. So this art
00:57:26 program was basically just turned your DS
00:57:28 into a tiny little Waycom tablet.
00:57:30 I did a bunch of art projects in college
00:57:32 on my DS because I was too lazy
00:57:34 to get up and go to my computer.
00:57:36 I don't blame you.
00:57:38 That's sick. That's sick.
00:57:40 I'll picto chat will always be in my heart
00:57:42 and I'll never forget it. Greatest app of all time.
00:57:46 Press effort DS.
00:57:48 You guys know who Jennifer Diane
00:57:50 writes is? Or maybe Reitz
00:57:52 I think it's Reitz. I don't think so.
00:57:54 She is a lol cow
00:57:56 She is like an old
00:57:58 past meme of a lol cow.
00:58:00 And I've mentioned her one or two times
00:58:02 because coincidentally
00:58:04 I used to post on the same
00:58:06 spore forums as her
00:58:08 in the lead up to the release of Spore
00:58:10 I was on this forum called Gaming Steve
00:58:12 which was
00:58:14 one of the places where
00:58:16 it had one of the most
00:58:18 active spore fan communities
00:58:20 because we were all really hyped
00:58:22 for spore. It was going to be a game changer.
00:58:24 All of the stray.
00:58:26 You were. I remember that.
00:58:28 And there was a poster on there called
00:58:30 Jennifer Diane writes and it turned out
00:58:32 she was kind of a famous lol cow
00:58:34 and I didn't know it at the time
00:58:36 but she was active there
00:58:38 and I went and I read
00:58:40 one of her old webcomics yesterday
00:58:42 it took me like all day
00:58:44 the comic was called
00:58:46 Unicorn Jelly
00:58:48 and it's really funny
00:58:50 it gets kind of good
00:58:52 but it's like
00:58:54 she's lecture worthy
00:58:56 maybe not specifically Unicorn Jelly
00:58:58 but maybe just all of her
00:59:00 comics together
00:59:02 because I mean
00:59:04 Unicorn Jelly is pretty complicated
00:59:06 but it's mostly complicated
00:59:08 and she puts
00:59:10 there's all this lore
00:59:12 there's a whole science
00:59:14 of how that universe works
00:59:16 I feel like the story is almost just a vehicle
00:59:18 for her to come up with weird sci-fi concepts
00:59:20 of how gravity
00:59:22 works through a completely different mechanism
00:59:24 in this world and how
00:59:26 the universe is structured in a completely different way
00:59:28 and it's based on different fundamental
00:59:30 physics laws and stuff
00:59:32 and I don't know
00:59:34 the art style is really funny
00:59:36 because there will be really big
00:59:38 pretty detailed
00:59:40 scenery shots that you can
00:59:42 tell a lot of effort went into
00:59:44 and that actually sometimes looks pretty cool
00:59:46 but then the actual character art
00:59:48 looks like I think
00:59:50 the whole thing was drawn with a mouse
00:59:52 and like the art
00:59:54 the character art is like super bad
00:59:56 sometimes
00:59:58 most of the time
01:00:00 it's like mushy, pseudo, anime
01:00:02 like Dominic Deegan
01:00:04 I like the design, I just googled it
01:00:06 Unicorn Jelly Him Herbs herself
01:00:08 looks cute, it's a cute design
01:00:10 you mean the jelly itself?
01:00:12 yeah sure
01:00:14 which I assume is the main character
01:00:16 basically not at all
01:00:18 okay I mean there are things
01:00:20 that the Unicorn, it's a uni
01:00:22 there are things that uni does
01:00:24 and like uni is in the story
01:00:26 through most of it but like
01:00:28 he, I think it's a he
01:00:30 is definitely not the main character
01:00:32 it's the main characters are basically
01:00:34 his adoptive mother
01:00:36 who is like a witch
01:00:38 who is just like shit at magic
01:00:40 well it's not even that she's shit at magic
01:00:42 and it's a problem
01:00:44 she's a witch but like she literally does
01:00:46 no magic over the course, she just doesn't engage with it
01:00:48 it's like not important
01:00:50 and then
01:00:52 her like adoptive
01:00:54 daughter who is actually like
01:00:56 a human girl who gets in
01:00:58 early on she gets like infected with like a crystal
01:01:00 disease
01:01:02 and like the magic of uni
01:01:04 uni's unicorn magic
01:01:06 like cures her but it doesn't fully cure her
01:01:08 and like the crystals like stay
01:01:10 in her body and they're like in her brain
01:01:12 and they turn her into like a super computer
01:01:14 girl kind of
01:01:16 and it's like it turns into some fucking
01:01:18 like Gurren Lagann like
01:01:20 migrate all of humanity across the cosmos
01:01:22 stuff
01:01:24 and it's website
01:01:26 it's fucking insane
01:01:28 unicornjelly.com
01:01:30 it's very classic it's very 90's
01:01:32 it's so like angel fire
01:01:34 I feel so at home right now
01:01:36 like in this odd sense of calm is
01:01:38 washing over me as I
01:01:40 really live my childhood
01:01:42 with her on website
01:01:44 I like
01:01:46 there's unicornjelly continues
01:01:48 as a film noir side story
01:01:50 that takes place in the same universe
01:01:52 to save her follows an alternate version
01:01:54 KY
01:01:56 and a cast of familiar faces as they seek
01:01:58 a mysterious goal while traveling among many different
01:02:00 alternate versions of the universe
01:02:02 of Tries
01:02:04 Lamastia I can't even pronounce that
01:02:06 yeah Tristle
01:02:08 um yeah
01:02:10 the the saga continues I guess
01:02:12 wait what wait what where's it called

01:02:34 damn but you know I like a lot of this sprite art
01:02:36 it looks nice
01:02:38 sometimes it looks good yeah
01:02:40 like okay there are times when like
01:02:42 they do like a close-up
01:02:44 in particular there's like a little girl character
01:02:46 with like big sparkly eyes who's like
01:02:48 eh weh weh
01:02:50 when uh who looks really
01:02:52 bad uh huh
01:02:54 like when you close up
01:02:56 close-ups on faces are really
01:02:58 they can be pretty fucking shit sometimes

01:03:22 there's like a chess game that exists
01:03:24 in this world called toss in

01:03:30 d&d 3.5
01:03:32 rule sets for all the creatures so you can put them
01:03:34 on their campaigns yeah and all the
01:03:36 all the characters have stat blocks and stuff

01:04:42 like 60 oh
01:04:44 well

01:04:50 damn I couldn't blame her unicorn jelly
01:04:52 I've used up three mice so far
01:04:54 I guess I am pretty hard on mice
01:04:56 the mouse I like is a Microsoft
01:04:58 Intellipoint so she draws
01:05:00 the mouse there's a
01:05:02 whole page there's a whole page about how
01:05:04 unicorn jelly is created and it's just a wall
01:05:06 of text about how she uses a mouse do you
01:05:08 think it'd be possible to like actually
01:05:10 acquire skill at drawing with a mouse
01:05:12 maybe the sensitivity or something
01:05:14 there's there's definitely people who draw

01:10:54 merry christmas dian
01:10:56 I can just see this
01:10:58 as the scene from hey arnold
01:11:00 but with like shittily pasted like twitter
01:11:02 cars over the faces
01:11:04 oh god please someone make it happen

01:11:24 your chances of getting a retweet go way up
01:11:26 they significantly rise
01:11:28 there's no doubt about it
01:11:30 dammit
01:11:32 I know there are other
01:11:34 jdr comics
01:11:36 I can't remember any of them right now
01:11:38 but a lot of them do involve
01:11:40 like slime or jelly
01:11:42 she definitely has
01:11:44 she's got the soul of a slime boy in her heart
01:11:46 she definitely has a certain
01:11:48 affinity for that
01:11:50 I think those crystals that populate her world
01:11:52 they have to be podrans right
01:11:54 oh yes pastel defender heliotrope
01:11:56 that's the other one
01:11:58 which
01:12:00 okay well obviously I have to read it
01:12:02 I think those are the two main ones
01:12:04 is unicorn jelly and pastel defender heliotrope
01:12:06 I'm opening that right now
01:12:08 sounds great report back with results
01:12:10 Ben says nothing for the rest of the podcast
01:12:12 just enamored by this new story
01:12:14 and apparently this one ran for
01:12:16 another like four years after
01:12:18 from 2004 to 2008
01:12:20 so after unicorn jelly
01:12:22 the work output is impressive
01:12:24 especially
01:12:26 she put out a comic like every weekday
01:12:28 and some of them are
01:12:30 like they start out as
01:12:32 just like three panel strips but like some of them
01:12:34 are like big like splash pages
01:12:36 there are some that are like 12 panels
01:12:38 or more
01:12:40 the work effort is admirable
01:12:42 this is the thing I genuinely
01:12:44 have come around a bit on like
01:12:46 christine weston chandler
01:12:48 that is, say what you want
01:12:50 about her and her work
01:12:52 her art skill
01:12:54 you're like her skill level
01:12:56 you can criticize all you want
01:12:58 but she has put out a lot of work
01:13:00 and like she has clearly
01:13:02 there's time put in there
01:13:04 and you have to respect that
01:13:06 there was a video or a vlog I wanted to make
01:13:08 at some point saying christ chan is a better artist
01:13:10 than you because christ chan actually
01:13:12 I like that
01:13:14 that's a really light of fire under somebody
01:13:16 you can be as good as you want
01:13:18 but if you don't produce anything
01:13:20 cause like there was a definition of art
01:13:22 that was on like a youtube video that I found really interesting
01:13:24 this was by simon cynic saying like
01:13:26 if you are a master craftsman
01:13:28 at like your chosen art but you don't share it
01:13:30 with anybody it's not art you're just a crafts person
01:13:32 to be an artist you have to publish something
01:13:34 and in that regard I think
01:13:36 the point is that like christ chan is obviously a better artist
01:13:38 than like 99% of people that don't actually
01:13:40 produce anything
01:13:42 that's super good
01:13:44 and a great take that I will defend
01:13:46 that's a very excellent youtube clickbait title
01:13:48 there's no doubt in my mind
01:13:50 that's been brewing for a few months
01:13:52 in the old noggin
01:13:54 cause I'm waging a silent war against art culture
01:13:56 cause I hate it
01:13:58 as Nate knows
01:14:00 and saw the opening sale
01:14:02 make art culture great again boys
01:14:04 what is art culture
01:14:06 a bunch of whining
01:14:08 entitled babies
01:14:10 for constantly on the internet
01:14:12 being like sorry for themselves
01:14:14 instead of like making their lives better
01:14:16 and I hate it
01:14:18 I'm making things
01:14:20 I'm making things every day
01:14:22 I got really close
01:14:24 to like finishing
01:14:26 the sketches
01:14:28 of this one comic
01:14:30 that I've been working on for a while
01:14:32 and the sketching part
01:14:34 is the hardest part
01:14:36 getting everything laid out
01:14:38 on where the character is
01:14:40 where the speech bubble is going
01:14:42 and how to go from one panel to the next
01:14:44 in a cool way
01:14:46 so that it works
01:14:48 I'm stuck right at the end
01:14:50 cause I didn't write exactly what happens
01:14:52 right at the end
01:14:54 it sucks so much
01:14:56 if there's any lesson to learn here
01:14:58 it's to do
01:15:00 as much pre-production
01:15:02 as possible
01:15:04 and early along as possible
01:15:06 like write down
01:15:08 a description of what you think the panel should look like
01:15:10 even
01:15:12 because then when it comes to drawing
01:15:14 one wrong line or a wrong pose
01:15:16 takes a lot longer than
01:15:18 typing the pose that you want
01:15:20 wait so what
01:15:22 what are you stuck on exactly
01:15:24 let me just make sure I understand exactly what you mean
01:15:26 I'm right at the end of this thing
01:15:28 but the thing is I had a script
01:15:30 I wrote up a script for
01:15:32 what happens in the comic
01:15:34 and this last bit
01:15:36 it doesn't have
01:15:38 there was a complication
01:15:40 I had to add something in
01:15:42 it's just sort of ruining the flow
01:15:44 and I don't know how to reconcile it
01:15:46 I'm only like 3 or 4 pages away from it being done
01:15:48 it's like 80 something pages long
01:15:50 awesome
01:15:52 so it's like
01:15:54 that reminds me
01:15:56 when I'm making
01:15:58 slime and punishment
01:16:00 and slime and punishment
01:16:02 I had a couple of
01:16:04 I guess none of them are
01:16:06 necessarily the ending
01:16:08 but I had a couple of scenes
01:16:10 this will conclude in this way
01:16:12 I had
01:16:14 the big moments in mind
01:16:16 and everything else is about
01:16:18 setting up and building
01:16:20 towards making those conclusions happen
01:16:22 so I kind of know the endings
01:16:24 and I
01:16:26 because then shit happened on twitter
01:16:28 and Christine
01:16:30 responded to stuff
01:16:32 some people on twitter
01:16:34 trolls mostly were saying
01:16:36 Ben don't listen to her
01:16:38 don't do what she wants
01:16:40 this is your comic
01:16:42 it's true
01:16:44 but the thing is that I find it
01:16:46 satisfying and a cool creative
01:16:48 exercise
01:16:50 to build chris's input
01:16:52 for her character into the story
01:16:54 the character should do what she would do
01:16:56 so I find it a cool challenge
01:16:58 and it's
01:17:00 valuable to me
01:17:02 to be like how can I
01:17:04 accommodate this
01:17:06 into the story
01:17:08 the things that are going to happen
01:17:10 are still going to happen
01:17:12 I'm working on a
01:17:14 detour now where phantom horn goes to the alpha timeline
01:17:16 to accomplish
01:17:18 some weird
01:17:20 shit
01:17:22 that chris made up
01:17:24 that she wants to happen in the alpha timeline
01:17:26 and it's really strange and funny
01:17:28 so that's another reason
01:17:30 it would be funny
01:17:32 this is so fucking bizarre
01:17:34 I just want to include it
01:17:36 I know we've talked about this before
01:17:38 but the one thing I'm most disappointed by
01:17:40 with Christine
01:17:42 is her insistence
01:17:44 on the fact that phantom has
01:17:46 obtained his horn
01:17:48 his arc is over
01:17:50 that ruins the character to do that
01:17:52 yes it is a nightmare
01:17:54 it is an absolute fucking nightmare
01:17:56 but you know what
01:17:58 we live in a multiverse
01:18:00 of infinite possibilities
01:18:02 I can't sit here and tell you that such a thing
01:18:04 could never happen
01:18:06 I can't do that
01:18:08 however I can
01:18:10 correct this little
01:18:12 there's nothing to stop
01:18:14 this horn from
01:18:16 rotting or something
01:18:18 corrupting and having to be so sawn off
01:18:20 otherwise he dies
01:18:22 I mean something must be done
01:18:24 something will be done
01:18:26 on earth as it is in heaven
01:18:28 as above so below
01:18:30 by the way
01:18:32 speaking of artistic integrity
01:18:34 I just wanted to say that
01:18:36 for the last bonus pcb episode we did
01:18:38 we did like a game development one
01:18:40 and a lot of us talked about our projects
01:18:42 and stuff and you should definitely go listen to the one
01:18:44 because that was a great episode
01:18:46 $5 patreon.com slash the procrastinators
01:18:48 32 full fucking bonus episodes now
01:18:50 Jesus Christ what a deal
01:18:52 and I wanted to say that
01:18:54 I talked to you guys a bunch
01:18:56 about the game that I've been working on
01:18:58 for years
01:19:00 we worked on it for several months
01:19:02 before I started doing YouTube
01:19:04 and we produced art assets
01:19:06 and I showed a bunch of that stuff
01:19:08 but I didn't have a working demo of the game
01:19:10 but just because I so wanted to
01:19:12 I spent like a full day
01:19:14 opening up my old laptop where I've been working
01:19:16 on that game trying to run the game
01:19:18 trying to get an exportable exe file
01:19:20 that I could share and I couldn't do it
01:19:22 but so I went back
01:19:24 and I fixed some broken things
01:19:26 and made like a working developer
01:19:28 version of the game and was able to
01:19:30 export it so it works as intended
01:19:32 on like window systems
01:19:34 and that's going to be attached to the
01:19:36 episodes so people can play the one
01:19:38 basic ass level that exists without any animations
01:19:40 like the basic functionality
01:19:42 worked pretty cool
01:19:44 and I loved doing it and it made me
01:19:46 be like oh maybe I could like work on this game
01:19:48 again it's like really fun and really good
01:19:50 do it so maybe I
01:19:52 fucking will dude maybe I fucking will
01:19:54 become more than a YouTuber become someone
01:19:56 of actual value
01:19:58 maybe I can do both maybe I can be a value
01:20:00 person and value less person
01:20:02 at the same time I gotta just add a link to my
01:20:04 old vlog uh analysis where creativity
01:20:06 goes to die so it would be inspired
01:20:08 hey you're not wrong I mean that's why
01:20:10 I like red letter media because like all along
01:20:12 they're also like occasionally
01:20:14 just like make a movie right and that's like
01:20:16 money where their mouth is
01:20:18 and I respect that greatly um
01:20:20 but like I loved it so much
01:20:22 I feel I'm gonna keep that exclusive
01:20:24 to the bonus episode but I gotta tell you
01:20:26 I really want to release it to like
01:20:28 the public at large because I like it so much
01:20:30 and I want people to see it so maybe
01:20:32 we'll consider that a limited time restriction
01:20:34 to the bonus episode and then afterward
01:20:36 I'll uh I'll let the boys out there
01:20:38 just force yourself to release it to the public
01:20:40 in a in a further developed
01:20:42 state well sensor every
01:20:44 asset in the game and it's only available
01:20:46 on the bonus episode
01:20:48 I could do that oh it felt so good
01:20:50 programming like like I mean I worked
01:20:52 for years as a programmer and it could
01:20:54 feel satisfying but I mean that was
01:20:56 you know whatever it is that's work it's a job
01:20:58 not that interesting but like you're working on your project
01:21:00 and then you get it working and you get
01:21:02 an exportable exe the first people can
01:21:04 play oh it feels good oh it feels
01:21:06 real good so uh it's
01:21:08 good stuff and I believe I did in fact make
01:21:10 those sprites and I feel real good about them
01:21:12 I love them and uh they're not animated
01:21:14 as there's there's a gift that
01:21:16 Gib produced of the little animation
01:21:18 in the bonus episode so that go look at that
01:21:20 to see what it would look like if
01:21:22 QT base drop
01:21:24 as I've decided to call her from that episode
01:21:26 get Quentin Tarantino
01:21:28 base drop that's her full name Quentin Tarantino
01:21:30 base drop her full name
01:21:32 so it has been decreed um
01:21:34 anyway good good good stuff good stuff go watch
01:21:36 that episode um
01:21:38 uh it was voice mails voice mails
01:21:40 I think I think it's time
01:21:42 well you got something else good well I had
01:21:44 just like a I've been cleaning
01:21:46 out my room no no I think we got it now I think
01:21:48 we're going to have to move along
01:21:50 but the room situation
01:21:52 well just clean out my room and I was
01:21:54 finding uh
01:21:56 stacks upon stacks of lined
01:21:58 paper and and and
01:22:00 yes stacks of of of
01:22:02 paper money that is oh yeah
01:22:04 no uh lined paper and like a scroll
01:22:06 of paper and all of this
01:22:08 unused um you know just
01:22:10 sitting there like blank paper
01:22:12 huge amounts of it um
01:22:14 all these notebooks and stuff and I'm
01:22:16 looking at them and I want to draw
01:22:18 on them but I don't also
01:22:20 want to draw on them because uh
01:22:22 drawing sucks and it's
01:22:24 it's bad have you been drawing a lot in your
01:22:26 in your comic and stuff yeah
01:22:28 it's online it's on the
01:22:30 the on the the internet
01:22:32 super highway the I mean the
01:22:34 tablet right so like
01:22:36 so like I've got all this
01:22:38 paper and I don't know what to do with it like if I fill
01:22:40 it up with stuff if I need to use it anywhere
01:22:42 I'll have to scan it or take a picture and that's
01:22:44 a fucking taking a picture is easy though right
01:22:46 I mean you could you know it's just an extra
01:22:48 little yeah but it's
01:22:50 scanning it in is like if
01:22:52 if I wanted to actually use it for something
01:22:54 I would need to do that when I
01:22:56 did the like because
01:22:58 the first
01:23:00 the first of vapor's chapter I like sketched
01:23:02 in pencil and scanned it in
01:23:04 and it was such a nightmare because I drew
01:23:06 it on big paper and
01:23:08 it was too big for the scanner so
01:23:10 I had to take like four I had to like scan
01:23:12 for like four different angles and then
01:23:14 combine the four scans into
01:23:16 one image and like remove
01:23:18 like imperfections from the scanning yeah
01:23:20 yeah yeah basically it'll
01:23:22 solve all your problems what is that Tom
01:23:24 down what is down with the app your phone
01:23:26 called cam scanner yeah take it open up
01:23:28 it works just like a camera you take
01:23:30 a photo of the page and it detects
01:23:32 the corners of the paper and you can manually
01:23:34 just them if need be and then it
01:23:36 it adjusts the
01:23:38 perspective so it's flat like it was in a camera
01:23:40 like a scanner bed and then does some
01:23:42 post-processing to clean up the image and
01:23:44 then you can save it anywhere and then it's like your phone
01:23:46 scanned it and you don't have to worry about
01:23:48 finangling with a scanner anything it's way faster
01:23:50 it's way easier I found
01:23:52 an incredibly helpful thing because I was
01:23:54 porting I was reformatting
01:23:56 slime and punishment for to plastic and web
01:23:58 tune and it was such a nightmare because
01:24:00 every like it's hundreds of images like
01:24:02 300 something images and
01:24:04 I had to go into each one like
01:24:06 like resize it basically
01:24:08 and like sit and like export right
01:24:10 and and it was really annoying and
01:24:12 someone on some form
01:24:14 or something I found there someone had
01:24:16 just made like a widget online
01:24:18 that you can it specifically
01:24:20 for to plastic and webtoon you can just like
01:24:22 select images and it will just like spit out
01:24:24 a resized version at the correct
01:24:26 and you can do it with whole batches of them
01:24:28 and it saved me hours
01:24:30 overjoyed it was
01:24:32 called crappie
01:24:34 and that's it
01:24:36 do you think it's worth putting bell
01:24:38 jpe through that yes
01:24:40 because why not well the
01:24:42 only thing is there's all the text underneath
01:24:44 the images and also the gifts
01:24:46 and stuff it would be like
01:24:48 yeah they'd take gifts
01:24:50 I don't
01:24:52 okay I know webtoon doesn't
01:24:56 which is why I haven't put
01:24:58 what's I have a beast
01:25:00 be escapades
01:25:02 because be escapades was lots of gifts and I know
01:25:04 web tapas I don't
01:25:06 think so but maybe webtoon
01:25:08 no webtoon will but you have
01:25:10 to be like a featured creator
01:25:12 or like it's some it's some fucking bullshit
01:25:14 class class system
01:25:16 or shit it's bad
01:25:18 yeah so
01:25:20 it's the problem with being interesting
01:25:22 all the rules fair time
01:25:24 that's your answer for everything Tom
01:25:26 it's the right way to go
01:25:28 I mean I agree that
01:25:30 yeah it's good to have a website but there's no pre
01:25:32 existing audience there right so why can't
01:25:34 you can't reach people through your website
01:25:36 like everybody like where all
01:25:38 of us like fucking pleb creators
01:25:40 online right we're all like using
01:25:42 Twitter and we're using YouTube and every time
01:25:44 YouTube or Twitter changes we all
01:25:46 bitch piss and moan about how bad it is and how we're
01:25:48 getting fucked but like if you look
01:25:50 at actual brands like real companies
01:25:52 like businesses that like understand like how
01:25:54 the world works unlike us
01:25:56 none of them do that
01:25:58 all of them use Facebook and
01:26:00 YouTube and Twitter as advertising platforms
01:26:02 to push you to their website
01:26:04 and get you on their email list so they can
01:26:06 stay in contact with you one-on-one and not to compete
01:26:08 with all the noise of social media
01:26:10 that's like good enough for Coca-Cola
01:26:12 it should be the de facto
01:26:14 model we're all just too lazy to put in the work
01:26:16 to actually build a proper platform the way
01:26:18 like regular companies would do it because it is
01:26:20 more effective it's a snow it's a snowflake
01:26:22 no snowflake blames itself for the
01:26:24 Blizzard it's kind of like no snowflake
01:26:26 no individual like Twitter artist or whatever
01:26:28 will want to bear
01:26:30 the full brunt of you know creating a new
01:26:32 thing so there's a lot of inertia there I would imagine
01:26:34 you don't you don't even just just make a website
01:26:36 it's not hard yeah
01:26:38 Squarespace this episode of the
01:26:40 Procrastin's podcast brought to you by Squarespace
01:26:42 Squarespace is the excellent
01:26:44 just go make your website on Squarespace
01:26:46 it fucking should be god damn it
01:26:48 Huell, call me back, sponsor me
01:26:50 for Christ's sake I still get
01:26:52 Huell residuals every now and then it gets
01:26:54 I was saying someone use someone use your code for
01:26:56 Huell here's $15 you gotta
01:26:58 talk about that after I gotta fucking at least
01:27:00 get that shit gone I don't fucking know
01:27:02 yeah all right we'll speak afterward
01:27:04 by the way
01:27:06 Gibb I was gonna say to your point
01:27:08 about like wanting to draw in a notebook
01:27:10 I assume because you like that
01:27:12 tactile I don't know sense or something
01:27:14 I've been what I've been doing the content
01:27:16 episodes with Digi I'll generally
01:27:18 either I'll write notes
01:27:20 on my whiteboard to like visually read so
01:27:22 it's easy to have you know know what I'm gonna say
01:27:24 or I'll write in my in like a physical notebook
01:27:26 I have this nice red notebook for my
01:27:28 old college days and I opened it up and I actually
01:27:30 just like finished filled up the last
01:27:32 available page and I couldn't help but
01:27:34 notice that like this originally was a
01:27:36 Japanese like learning notebook
01:27:38 I was using and it's just filled with page
01:27:40 after page after page of me
01:27:42 doing exercises and like just repeating
01:27:44 kanji and repeating hiragana
01:27:46 and like repeating vocabulary words
01:27:48 because I would just endlessly write those over
01:27:50 and over in the book to learn them
01:27:52 and it it maybe just feel like
01:27:54 I mean this is different from what you were talking about
01:27:56 I was just like ooh I really liked learning Japanese
01:27:58 that's another thing I should you know actively do
01:28:00 day to day which I have
01:28:02 definitely been lazy on most I've done is like follow
01:28:04 a bunch of learn Japanese Twitter accounts
01:28:06 so I'm at least bombarded by a couple
01:28:08 of words every day but it's certainly not
01:28:10 enough one day one day
01:28:12 man I do
01:28:14 like seeing some of these half
01:28:16 filled up books with like
01:28:18 years old like
01:28:20 like this one of
01:28:22 these has like physics
01:28:24 homework things and then like
01:28:26 on another page it's like
01:28:28 um ideas for
01:28:30 a Super Mario World of Warcraft
01:28:32 RPG MMO
01:28:34 where you can you can choose the faction you can
01:28:36 be like a goomba and you can level up and get
01:28:38 goomba equipment and run
01:28:40 around in a field
01:28:42 I thought it was such a sick idea
01:28:44 and and then there's like
01:28:46 like other game things I want to do
01:28:48 and then like spreadsheets I was
01:28:50 trying to write up for
01:28:52 for keeping track of my actual World of
01:28:54 Warcraft crafting
01:28:56 bullshit it's nice looking back
01:28:58 at all these stupid things I was
01:29:00 they cared about
01:29:02 you know just for some reason that just reminds me
01:29:04 of there's a game that came out
01:29:06 relatively recently that
01:29:08 it was a total indie like Kickstarter game
01:29:10 or something and it's it's
01:29:12 literally exactly like Paper Mario
01:29:14 so it's like filling the niche of the
01:29:16 classic Paper Mario and like thousand
01:29:18 year door game it's supposed to be like it's
01:29:20 exactly like them but
01:29:22 it's got the same papercraft design but it's just about
01:29:24 like bugs it's kind of like Hollow Knight
01:29:26 meets uh Paper Mario
01:29:28 and it looks wonderful but I just
01:29:30 haven't investigated whether it's good or not
01:29:32 what's it called you know I cannot
01:29:34 fucking remember I'm gonna Google it now
01:29:36 and see if I can figure it out
01:29:38 but it looks super good
01:29:40 hang on Paper Mario
01:29:42 it's called
01:29:44 Bug Fables that's the one
01:29:46 an exploration RPG full of bugs
01:29:48 on Indiegogo it was funded
01:29:50 man I really hope it doesn't launch with bugs
01:29:52 oh yeah it is just Paper Mario
01:29:54 and you know what
01:29:56 I fucking loved Paper Mario 1
01:29:58 and 2 especially
01:30:00 so I like it's an RPG
01:30:02 it looks great I think like the battle
01:30:04 system in Paper Mario was like one of my
01:30:06 favorites ever so I should
01:30:08 fucking play this game is the is the long and short of it
01:30:10 I'll get back to you if in fact
01:30:12 I do do so
01:30:14 that's what I've got that's my story
01:30:16 neat pretty fucking neat oh
01:30:18 I'm always happy to see like a
01:30:20 little Indie company
01:30:22 like come in to like fill the void of like
01:30:24 man no one makes Castlevania anymore
01:30:26 and like so Ega breaks off from Capcom
01:30:28 makes like Bloodstained and I'm like
01:30:30 yes this scratches my fucking itch
01:30:32 and whenever that happens it's always
01:30:34 a good thing more competition more games

01:32:24 go do you guys
01:32:26 like shadow the hedgehog
01:32:28 from the sonic video game

01:32:44 so cool
01:32:46 he's so cool you see
01:32:48 he has a gun and sick roller skates
01:32:50 I've never played a sonic game in my entire life
01:32:52 really
01:32:54 play shadow the hedgehog as your first
01:32:56 sonic game
01:32:58 it's a little bit of like sonic
01:33:00 and knuckles
01:33:02 let me convince you in one sentence
01:33:04 shadow is absolutely a killer
01:33:06 that's true
01:33:08 that's so true
01:33:10 I mean killer is very much a shadow the hedgehog
01:33:12 I understand the man
01:33:14 can anyone really
01:33:16 understand the man
01:33:18 the hedgehog
01:33:20 you don't understand the man at all
01:33:22 actually I was just watching
01:33:24 I was just watching
01:33:26 a bunch of sonic adventure videos
01:33:28 by a guy called the black hooded gamer
01:33:30 I don't know why
01:33:32 they got recommended to me
01:33:34 I watched a bunch of several hour long videos
01:33:36 he made explaining the appeal of sonic adventure
01:33:38 and sonic adventure 2
01:33:40 I know everything about
01:33:42 sonic adventure
01:33:44 and I don't know why
01:33:46 I played the fucking sonic adventure 2 back in the day
01:33:48 it was sick
01:33:50 I saw a unate play
01:33:52 I played a bit
01:33:54 all I want for Christmas
01:33:56 in my stocking
01:33:58 is the
01:34:00 hypocrite ghost in the shell video
01:34:02 of shadow the hedgehog
01:34:04 that's all I want one day
01:34:06 please let it happen
01:34:08 oh a review of shadow the hedgehog
01:34:10 yes I want the deep lore
01:34:12 I want all the memes
01:34:14 I don't know the deep lore
01:34:16 he's got a gun that's pretty deep
01:34:18 he's the gun girl of shadow the hedgehog
01:34:20 what more do you need
01:34:22 sonic lore would make a good lecture
01:34:24 I mean that's definitely true
01:34:26 but are any of us qualified
01:34:28 you'd have to like
01:34:30 the comic should be their own lecture by itself
01:34:32 there's like a fucking 40 year history
01:34:34 like 40 year canon to that at this point
01:34:36 I mean that's a great idea
01:34:38 but none of us
01:34:40 currently have expertise
01:34:42 just do a shadow the hedgehog lecture
01:34:44 just take the one man
01:34:46 break down his narrative
01:34:48 him making out with that girl
01:34:50 the hedgehog lecture
01:34:52 or his shadow the hedgehog doing a lecture
01:34:54 dressed as a hedgehog
01:34:56 for the lecture please
01:34:58 which is basically just a Ryuko costume
01:35:00 just wear that and
01:35:02 have a gun instead of a sword
01:35:04 that works
01:35:06 okay next voicemail
01:35:08 let me see what do we got this
01:35:10 oh right this was like a weird one
01:35:12 I think this was a Welsh guy
01:35:14 and it was Talys in Ap Gruffind
01:35:16 from McNeilith
01:35:18 or something
01:35:20 I don't know it's some Welsh bullshit
01:35:22 we know how we feel about those
01:35:24 let's give him a chance here
01:35:26 oh yeah we hate them I guess
01:35:48 of course is banning McDonald's
01:35:50 McDonald's is a scourge on health
01:35:52 nationwide and it must be stopped
01:35:54 Clyde Cymru will not rest
01:35:56 until Ronald McDonald himself
01:35:58 is hanging in Penderean Square
01:36:00 for treason
01:36:02 I think we can all agree that this policy
01:36:04 is for the best
01:36:06 number two all education will be done
01:36:08 in the medium of Welsh
01:36:10 English speaking children must be taken
01:36:12 from their biological parents at a young age
01:36:14 and re-homed in state run
01:36:16 parties to revive the original town
01:36:18 of the Britons
01:36:20 half of the course really
01:36:22 number three a plan titled simply
01:36:24 get fucked New Zealand you fucking
01:36:26 rems
01:36:28 this plan is essential for the party's aims
01:36:30 it seeks to rename the town of
01:36:32 planfirepultwingelcogeirachwindrobol
01:36:34 and dsiliogogogog to be
01:36:36 even longer
01:36:38 we only really want to do this because
01:36:40 New Zealand apparently has the longest place
01:36:42 name in the world but I think we can do better
01:36:44 anyway I think I've made myself very clear
01:36:46 and I'm glad to have shown you the light
01:36:48 Diolch yn fawr
01:36:52 the Welsh are not people
01:36:54 I mean let's just say it they just don't qualify
01:36:56 Welsh is a cool language
01:36:58 I have seen
01:37:00 me too
01:37:02 I did see the Plaid Cymru
01:37:04 Cymraeg
01:37:08 a leader give a speech about
01:37:10 Welsh stuff
01:37:12 I do know what he is talking about
01:37:14 unfortunately there is not a Plaid Cymru
01:37:18 you know minister
01:37:20 you'll have to write him in
01:37:22 standing in my constituency
01:37:24 so I wouldn't be able to vote for them
01:37:26 even if I wanted to
01:37:28 join the party and then
01:37:30 just in my okay
01:37:32 the Welsh I mean I like this idea of like
01:37:34 Welsh infiltrators running in like
01:37:36 I mean not just all of England but like
01:37:38 all of Britain rather but in all of
01:37:40 society worldwide
01:37:42 to impose Welsh
01:37:44 cultural hegemony
01:37:46 or hegemony over all of society
01:37:48 as we found the master race
01:37:50 I'm convinced by their silly accent
01:37:52 which is very pleasing to the ear
01:37:54 yeah that's good thanks
01:37:56 guys keep it coming I love the Welsh accent
01:37:58 what can I say oh hey little welcome
01:38:00 I'm a little bit old
01:38:02 just the Blarney stone yeah there you go
01:38:06 tell it to the Blarney stone smash it
01:38:08 into face
01:38:10 of political opponent
01:38:12 alright here we go
01:38:14 next up is oh thank god okay
01:38:16 calling in is allegedly
01:38:18 the first failure of Find Purpose
01:38:20 November who somebody bought a shirt
01:38:22 at least one person so
01:38:24 they say that this is them
01:38:26 I haven't checked if anyone else has bought some
01:38:28 I know at least one so this could be them
01:38:30 so let's hear their story
01:38:32 okay go
01:38:34 I'm here to claim my title as the first
01:38:36 failure of Find Purpose November
01:38:38 I'm like 90% sure
01:38:40 that was the first person to buy the shirt
01:38:42 so it's only right
01:38:44 that I can also claim the title
01:38:46 so here's reason number one
01:38:48 why I'm the first failure
01:38:50 of Find Purpose November
01:38:52 it's over
01:38:54 it's so fucking over
01:38:56 you know what I do instead of like
01:38:58 going outside or going to school
01:39:00 or like working I stay inside
01:39:02 all day playing
01:39:04 motherfucking cookie clicker
01:39:06 and it's a good game
01:39:08 it's like a decent game it's like autistic
01:39:10 there's a ton of tiff and I'm playing
01:39:12 free fucking save files
01:39:14 because that's how I am
01:39:16 instead of like talking to people or like making connections
01:39:18 I'm just clicking those fucking
01:39:20 cookies
01:39:22 so this not voice mail is long enough
01:39:24 I'm gonna check back in with the other reasons
01:39:26 why I'm the first
01:39:28 failure of fucking Find
01:39:30 fucking Purpose November
01:39:32 I'm already convinced
01:39:34 I have a question
01:39:36 it sounds like they have a very clear and defined purpose
01:39:38 like destroy cookie clicker
01:39:40 like become the greatest at it
01:39:42 they're working every day at it
01:39:44 no there's no way to become the greatest
01:39:46 everyone who plays cookie clicker for an extended period of time
01:39:48 is the loser of cookie clicker
01:39:50 it's an endless skinner box
01:39:52 alright I just want to post an image
01:39:54 your purpose has been defined
01:39:56 their purpose is to play cookie clicker
01:39:58 it's not like they're aimless they're not wondering what to do
01:40:00 they know exactly what to do
01:40:02 counterpoint I think that this person
01:40:04 aspires to do better things
01:40:06 than cookie clicker and they feel guilt
01:40:08 at playing cookie clicker
01:40:10 so they don't consider it their purpose
01:40:12 they consider it a failure
01:40:14 now if they has given up on everything else
01:40:16 and only wanted to play cookie clicker
01:40:18 that would be perhaps a different story
01:40:20 but they feel avoid
01:40:22 I had a bit of a cookie meltdown
01:40:24 a few months ago
01:40:26 where I was just doing that
01:40:28 and I wasn't feeling anything
01:40:30 feeling depressed
01:40:32 but I managed to rage quit
01:40:34 I'm going to post an image
01:40:36 she will understand what this means
01:40:38 and that thing right there
01:40:40 is what caused me
01:40:42 like I had tried to do this three times
01:40:44 and this was the third failure
01:40:46 to get the prestige level
01:40:48 777
01:40:50 777
01:40:52 and I just got so mad
01:40:54 it unlocks
01:40:56 some special upgrades
01:40:58 that you can buy that increase
01:41:00 golden cookie bullshit
01:41:02 and if you miss it you have to restart
01:41:04 if you miss it you need to go for the next
01:41:06 777
01:41:08 10 times more
01:41:10 so it was like
01:41:12 I was so mad
01:41:14 I missed it by one
01:41:16 I was so careful
01:41:18 but I think
01:41:20 damn
01:41:22 I was waiting it was going to take 20 minutes
01:41:24 so I clicked the cookie once
01:41:26 like I didn't need to call
01:41:28 my cookie making
01:41:30 I clicked it once
01:41:32 and I think it was like a reindeer jumped in front of my click
01:41:34 and I got a billion cookie
01:41:36 well
01:41:38 way more than that
01:41:40 tiny amount
01:41:42 it was so upsetting
01:41:44 that I luckily
01:41:46 using the ability of gamer rage
01:41:48 I broke the curse
01:41:50 and I never want to go back
01:41:52 I would say that it's a bad thing
01:41:54 to get mad at video games
01:41:56 I think not
01:41:58 try getting mad
01:42:00 try failing
01:42:02 maybe this is the way to break the spell
01:42:04 well ok next voicemail
01:42:06 we've got a couple more here
01:42:08 oh ok here we go
01:42:10 we've got a business idea for Ben
01:42:12 let's hear what he has
01:42:14 alright this will be great
01:42:16 hello PCP
01:42:18 welcome to quick business ideas
01:42:20 I'm your host Jeremy Zuma
01:42:22 and today I've got the idea for Ben
01:42:24 so just put two ad spaces
01:42:26 on the side of samecomics.com
01:42:28 and put a little note on the bottom
01:42:30 be like
01:42:32 please disable that ad block
01:42:34 if you want to support me with my
01:42:36 comic disc comics
01:42:38 that's all
01:42:40 see you in the next one
01:42:42 great
01:42:44 what do you think Ben? I think he's got big ideas
01:42:46 just do that
01:42:48 stick some ads in there
01:42:50 and tell them to turn off ad block
01:42:52 what a winning proposition
01:42:54 let me see
01:42:56 how many people
01:42:58 I don't actively promote
01:43:00 stcomics.com
01:43:02 I've been doing stuff on webtoon
01:43:04 trying to build a following on webtoon
01:43:06 I don't know why
01:43:08 why not
01:43:10 let me see
01:43:12 exactly how many people
01:43:14 actually go to stcomics.com
01:43:16 200,000
01:43:18 that'd be nice
01:43:20 what's the
01:43:22 what's the
01:43:24 what's the fucking service? it's not ad sense
01:43:26 google analytics
01:43:28 google analytics that's it
01:43:30 google analytics
01:43:32 when was the last time I even
01:43:34 google analytics
01:43:36 am I signed in
01:43:38 yes
01:43:40 here we go
01:43:42 this is
01:43:44 I want to look at that
01:43:46 I want to look at stcomics.com
01:43:50 on the edge of my seat
01:43:52 I'm dying
01:43:54 no this is going to be good
01:43:56 with anticipation I mean
01:43:58 oh
01:44:00 okay
01:44:02 it looks like it's getting
01:44:04 where do they come from
01:44:06 but it's getting like 20
01:44:08 ish users a day
01:44:10 okay
01:44:12 that's way more than I expected
01:44:14 holy shit
01:44:16 maybe people are coming back checking for updates
01:44:18 oh my god
01:44:20 in the last 28 days
01:44:22 exactly 420 users bro
01:44:24 oh shit
01:44:26 here we go
01:44:28 time to change the color of the website
01:44:30 to be white and green
01:44:32 or black and green
01:44:34 I'm very shocked
01:44:36 I kind of expected it to be like 4
01:44:38 um
01:44:40 yeah
01:44:42 I know for a fact
01:44:44 I just
01:44:46 I just visited bell jpe the other day
01:44:48 because I wanted to watch the
01:44:50 the finale again
01:44:52 because I
01:44:54 because I'm kind of thinking about
01:44:56 I'm kind of working on a
01:44:58 little project
01:45:00 is there going to be a fucking
01:45:02 shut the fuck up
01:45:04 you shut the fuck up
01:45:06 you were the one who made the connection
01:45:08 I was just asking a question
01:45:10 yes the answer is yes there is going to be
01:45:12 a dot dot dot
01:45:14 yeah I'm going to make a little
01:45:16 I'm going to make a little thing
01:45:18 I wanted to draw some inspiration
01:45:20 oh shit
01:45:22 and again I was
01:45:24 I was like oh my god this is so much work
01:45:26 it won't
01:45:28 it will not
01:45:30 I won't put that much work into it
01:45:32 no
01:45:34 the quality of it
01:45:36 is lessened by the
01:45:38 length and stuff
01:45:40 the amount of stuff I tried to put into that
01:45:42 I wanted it to be even longer
01:45:44 it's not that it's too long
01:45:46 I had just forgotten how many frames
01:45:48 there are
01:45:50 a lot of it is like animated animated
01:45:52 instead of just like
01:45:54 I plan on using all the shortcuts I can
01:45:56 and just using tweens
01:45:58 really that's the smart thing to do
01:46:00 that's what you should do
01:46:02 really yeah
01:46:04 it doesn't make much of a difference
01:46:06 for it to be like animated
01:46:08 I just I don't really
01:46:10 understand like flash
01:46:12 or like
01:46:14 tweens and stuff and I could learn but I just
01:46:16 I know how to draw frame by frame stuff
01:46:18 be like me and animate in Sony Vegas
01:46:20 and import all your images
01:46:22 one at a time you know move to the next frame
01:46:24 drop in the new clip
01:46:26 easy peasy
01:46:28 it's the best frame by frame
01:46:30 you still need to draw them if they're drawn
01:46:32 no you can stretch and skew
01:46:34 on the screen
01:46:36 yes you just rotate it
01:46:38 that's the way
01:46:40 rotation solves everything
01:46:42 okay let's cover our tracks
01:46:44 let's get out of here and no one follow
01:46:46 to these mysterious things we're discussing
01:46:48 and go to
01:46:50 here's a voicemail called
01:46:52 don't say stupid shit about VR
01:46:54 this episode okay
01:46:56 we'll see if that happens
01:46:58 I don't know when you guys record but I'm hoping
01:47:00 I can get this before you record for next week
01:47:02 because the new Half-Life game was just
01:47:04 announced
01:47:06 but I wanted to clear up some misconceptions
01:47:08 about VR in the new game
01:47:10 before you guys say any stupid
01:47:12 uninformed bullshit
01:47:14 first VR is not
01:47:16 expensive anymore you can get a windows mix
01:47:18 reality headset which can play the game
01:47:20 for under $200
01:47:22 it comes with motion controllers
01:47:24 and it's a full room scale
01:47:26 experience with little compromise
01:47:28 it does not require
01:47:30 high-end hardware anymore
01:47:32 you can play VR games
01:47:34 on low to mid-range hardware
01:47:36 now and the new Half-Life game
01:47:38 does require 12 gigabytes of RAM
01:47:40 but you can play it on a GTX
01:47:42 1060 or an RX 5
01:47:44 alright
01:47:46 the new game VR only is
01:47:48 not arbitrary and it's not
01:47:50 meant to sell index headsets because
01:47:52 as I said you can play it with windows mix reality
01:47:54 and there are many
01:47:56 many things in VR
01:47:58 which cannot be translated to a mouse
01:48:00 and keyboard and people may be
01:48:02 disappointed but urban environments
01:48:04 like in city 17 would be much better
01:48:06 than outdoor wide environments
01:48:08 than the Arctic which Half-Life 3
01:48:10 would take place in
01:48:12 don't say anything stupid or I'm gonna die
01:48:14 I like it
01:48:16 I apologize for all the stupid things I meant to say
01:48:18 here's my fucking hot take
01:48:20 Half-Life's gay and it sucks
01:48:22 all games are gay
01:48:24 wait the new one
01:48:26 sorry this is dumb the new game
01:48:28 is not Half-Life 3
01:48:30 it's Half-Life something
01:48:32 something
01:48:34 Half-Life's Alex is a VR
01:48:36 I can't remember I think I never beat
01:48:38 episode 2 because the last thing
01:48:40 that you have to do
01:48:42 is like a tower defense game
01:48:44 kind of where there's the big striders
01:48:46 coming and you go to drive around
01:48:48 in your buggy and get these bombs
01:48:50 and shoot the bombs up so they stick on the stride
01:48:52 and then shoot the bombs on the stride
01:48:54 the so and so device
01:48:56 I lost once
01:48:58 and I was like this is never gonna fucking
01:49:00 happen
01:49:02 you played through the entirety of
01:49:04 Half-Life 2
01:49:06 episode 1 and episode 2 and then you got to the
01:49:08 final boss and we're like
01:49:10 too hard that happens sometimes
01:49:12 I don't
01:49:14 really like first person shooters
01:49:16 but Half-Life is a big game
01:49:18 I only played it like the other
01:49:20 like last year
01:49:22 I never beat any of them
01:49:24 I played it when it was
01:49:26 not new but like
01:49:28 I played it in the days of the orange box
01:49:30 I think I played it then too
01:49:32 yeah
01:49:34 the thing that came out
01:49:36 is like
01:49:38 I haven't really seen
01:49:40 much of people's reactions to it
01:49:42 aside from Jim Sterling talking about it
01:49:44 and saying he has trouble
01:49:46 with VR a lot
01:49:48 so that's a problem for him accessibility
01:49:50 or whatever
01:49:54 yo let me
01:49:56 it's a game I don't know
01:49:58 this is the thing about VR games
01:50:00 first of all investing $200
01:50:02 to get into VR in general
01:50:04 I mean that's less than a console
01:50:06 it is less than a console that's true
01:50:08 but the reason why I'm skeptical isn't really
01:50:10 that I don't think I could potentially get
01:50:12 my money's worth in terms of
01:50:14 VR games
01:50:16 the thing is that I'm extremely suspicious
01:50:18 of VR games
01:50:20 as games that are worth my time
01:50:22 in general
01:50:24 I'm looking at this game
01:50:26 are games actually good
01:50:28 there are some games that are good
01:50:30 my brother has bought a VR headset
01:50:32 for use in developing VR games
01:50:34 and I've tried it
01:50:36 and it is
01:50:38 the gimmick
01:50:40 of being in a real place
01:50:42 when you come down and there you are
01:50:44 I played this game
01:50:46 which is basically just like
01:50:48 a
01:50:50 hang out
01:50:52 like a quest
01:50:54 it's very cute
01:50:56 and you're just sort of in a place
01:50:58 where there's cute animals
01:51:00 and you move around and you pick up things
01:51:02 and you can craft items
01:51:04 and it's very chill
01:51:06 normally a game like that
01:51:08 I would turn on
01:51:10 but
01:51:12 the fact that it is there
01:51:14 in front of you
01:51:16 you can pick up the bird that's tweeting
01:51:18 and you can rotate it around your hand
01:51:20 these controllers he has
01:51:22 I think it's the new Vive
01:51:24 it is so satisfying
01:51:26 just to experience
01:51:28 being in the 3D world
01:51:30 I feel like
01:51:32 they don't have to impress you
01:51:34 as much as other games do
01:51:36 in order to be as impressive
01:51:38 you know I do know what you mean
01:51:40 you're absolutely right
01:51:42 there's definitely some unique strengths that VR has
01:51:44 for this very trailer
01:51:46 that is in the description for Half-Life Alex
01:51:48 at 55 seconds
01:51:50 there's a little clip where
01:51:52 the guy leans over, he looks through an area
01:51:54 he sees a couple combine soldiers
01:51:56 and then what happens
01:51:58 the problem is I don't believe that this is going to be the game
01:52:00 or it's going to be as intense as it looks
01:52:02 he sees the soldiers
01:52:04 he leans over to a bookshelf
01:52:06 of items aside to reveal there are bullets behind it
01:52:08 he then like picks them up
01:52:10 like clearly using a VR handy
01:52:12 reaches over, grabs it
01:52:14 opens the gun, puts the bullet
01:52:16 in the gun, then lowers the thing
01:52:18 cocks it and then turns around
01:52:20 and shoots a combine who has just noticed him
01:52:22 I do not believe
01:52:24 that the game is
01:52:26 like going to
01:52:28 in a high-paced, satisfying way
01:52:30 expect you to do all those things
01:52:32 in such rapid succession
01:52:34 I think they're presenting
01:52:36 basically a falsehood in this trailer
01:52:38 because I do not believe
01:52:40 I saw that as well, I didn't think that
01:52:42 because I've used these sorts of controllers
01:52:44 a little bit
01:52:46 they're kind of bulky
01:52:48 and they sort of wrap around your hand
01:52:50 if you were trying to do that with your actual hands
01:52:52 you'd knock the controllers against each other
01:52:54 I feel like some of that must have been like an animation
01:52:56 like the reloading and the cocking
01:52:58 was just probably him pressing a button
01:53:00 to get it loaded
01:53:02 see, I felt a little bit manipulated
01:53:04 maybe you're right, but because it's VR
01:53:06 I feel like at least this trailer
01:53:08 is giving false hope
01:53:10 for the things you can do
01:53:12 it's this intellectual cap
01:53:14 of functionality
01:53:16 that I'm thinking about lately
01:53:18 I know that things are only going to get so complex
01:53:20 and there's a shot right after that
01:53:22 where a bunch of combined soldiers come up to you
01:53:24 and there's an animation
01:53:26 of these two hands going up like you're surrendering
01:53:28 and when I first watched that
01:53:30 I thought to myself like
01:53:32 is the game trying to make me believe
01:53:34 that soldiers will respond to you
01:53:36 but if you put your hands up in VR
01:53:38 they'll know you're surrendering and they won't shoot you
01:53:40 I feel like that's what it's like hinting
01:53:42 but there's no way
01:53:44 there's no way
01:53:46 there's not no way but
01:53:48 I don't believe that the complexity is there
01:53:50 the behavior patterns are going to be that
01:53:52 it's got to be a cutscene
01:53:54 the complexity, that is possible to do
01:53:56 but I feel like
01:53:58 I just don't think we're there yet
01:54:00 I feel like that
01:54:02 a thing like that is something that will happen
01:54:04 like 80% of the time
01:54:06 and sometimes you put your hands up and they don't respond
01:54:08 that's going to 80% failure
01:54:10 80% success rate
01:54:12 like any motion control thing
01:54:14 the thing is though
01:54:16 I'm in the position where I could
01:54:18 buy the game because I already have
01:54:20 the access to a headset
01:54:22 it's a pretty good headset and controllers
01:54:24 but I'm not interested
01:54:26 really in the conclusion to the Half-Life saga
01:54:28 because
01:54:30 I don't really give a shit
01:54:32 but
01:54:34 I don't think
01:54:36 your reservations
01:54:38 if you're interested in
01:54:40 playing this game
01:54:42 for learning about what happens next in Half-Life
01:54:44 then I don't think it's going to be a massive disappointment
01:54:46 like you're imagining
01:54:48 most trailers
01:54:50 show up the best bits
01:54:52 of all the games they're from
01:54:54 typically trusted to be exactly this way
01:54:56 or exactly that
01:54:58 and there's no way for you to
01:55:00 truly experience what it will feel like
01:55:02 because you don't have a headset
01:55:04 by watching
01:55:06 but by watching
01:55:08 like a 2D version of the thing
01:55:10 it won't feel the same if you watch a trailer
01:55:12 or if you watch someone's Let's Play
01:55:14 so like there's always
01:55:16 a bit of like gamble
01:55:18 in buying a VR game in that sense
01:55:20 I mean it looks
01:55:22 pretty good
01:55:24 I mean what's the best VR game ever made
01:55:26 I would bet it's significantly less complex
01:55:28 than what's being showed off in this trailer
01:55:30 people really like Superhot
01:55:32 that's a pretty Superhot game
01:55:34 and that game is way less complex than the one
01:55:36 reloading animation that you do
01:55:38 in this very trailer
01:55:40 and maybe it's a button but it's clearly designed
01:55:42 in this trailer to make it look like you're doing this stuff
01:55:44 in VR
01:55:46 at least for that reloading section
01:55:48 I mean is that going to
01:55:50 like
01:55:52 if the reloading is like
01:55:54 not as complex as you would like
01:55:56 are you going to like throw your controller down
01:55:58 like fuck this shit storm out
01:56:00 what I will be is mad that they did
01:56:02 basically false advertising
01:56:04 because it clearly looks like that's
01:56:06 I mean I know it's complicated
01:56:08 it's hard to tell what is being promised and what isn't
01:56:10 but like looking at this
01:56:12 my instincts first told me
01:56:14 that's what's being presented here
01:56:16 and I'm relatively savvy on these things
01:56:18 but I don't think it's going to be easy
01:56:20 to think that this is kind of an intentional sequence
01:56:22 maybe it's just a fucking cutscene
01:56:24 I guess
01:56:26 but then like this is a VR game
01:56:28 why are we showing off cutscenes
01:56:30 alright
01:56:32 you're making a lot of assumptions
01:56:34 I'm not saying it's definitely like this
01:56:36 I understand your reservations
01:56:38 but like I don't think
01:56:40 I don't think they're
01:56:42 like if you think that this could be
01:56:44 like bullshit
01:56:46 you're not over your eyes
01:56:48 you are able to be like more cynical about it
01:56:50 and then
01:56:52 I'd say realistic
01:56:54 you're arguing from
01:56:56 no no no I'm arguing like
01:56:58 I'm saying that you're arguing
01:57:00 that the trailer is false advertising
01:57:02 even though you've
01:57:04 like quote unquote seen through it
01:57:06 so it doesn't affect you specifically
01:57:08 it is like a thing saying how dare they do
01:57:10 false advertising
01:57:12 but for you you see for what it truly is
01:57:14 your purchasing decision is not like
01:57:16 you're not being manipulated
01:57:18 because you saw through it
01:57:20 there's a grey area here
01:57:22 like I'm aware that
01:57:24 they didn't like specifically say
01:57:26 these are the exact things that you will physically do
01:57:28 with your hands in the game
01:57:30 they simply showed off some scenes
01:57:32 and we can draw our own conclusions from that
01:57:34 does it look good to you?
01:57:36 I think some people
01:57:38 here's what I fear
01:57:40 I think some people will see that
01:57:42 and they'll think to themselves
01:57:44 wow I'm gonna be able to do that in VR
01:57:46 like look how technical and complex that is
01:57:48 VR sure has advanced
01:57:50 and I think that they will be disappointed
01:57:52 if they expect that
01:57:54 what exactly is the thing that is like supposed to be
01:57:56 like too complex
01:57:58 look at 55 seconds in this trailer here
01:58:00 and there's just a little animation of a guy
01:58:02 like doing a reload that involves several steps
01:58:04 of him like finding ammo
01:58:06 behind a thing
01:58:08 like shooting out the old casing
01:58:10 like sticking it in the gun
01:58:12 lowering the hammer or the barrel or whatever
01:58:14 and then cocking it and then turning around
01:58:16 and shooting a guy
01:58:18 like that to me looks like it's supposed to be gameplay
01:58:20 but I don't believe that the game
01:58:22 is actually going to expect to do those things
01:58:24 I mean it looks like it could just be an animation playing
01:58:26 um
01:58:28 I mean yeah it could be
01:58:30 but I don't know why is the game like
01:58:32 like playing itself like finding ammo for you
01:58:34 in a cutscene
01:58:36 I don't know
01:58:38 a container
01:58:40 was there a button that loots item, reloads gun
01:58:42 and shoots enemy for you
01:58:44 it doesn't claim that there is or isn't
01:58:46 well yeah
01:58:48 I just think it's a stretch to like
01:58:50 go straight to the false advertising thing
01:58:52 like you can say you want to learn
01:58:54 do not say that Nate is putting the big red stamp
01:58:56 false advertising how clear do I have to be
01:58:58 there is a fucking gray area
01:59:00 that I've been saying repeatedly
01:59:02 is what I'm trying to establish here
01:59:04 and I think we're somewhere in there
01:59:06 that's like no position of Nate
01:59:08 what do you
01:59:10 what do you think
01:59:12 I don't know what's the problem
01:59:14 I wish that they put at the bottom of the scene
01:59:16 if it's a cutscene this is a cutscene
01:59:18 not gameplay
01:59:20 I don't think it is a cutscene
01:59:22 I suspect I'm not wrong
01:59:24 about this
01:59:26 it just looks like a canned animation
01:59:28 would be
01:59:30 no no in terms of what I need to say
01:59:32 it looks like
01:59:34 you know when you're playing a video game
01:59:36 like a first person shooter you're running around
01:59:38 shooting and then you hit X and it does
01:59:40 a canned animation of reloading the gun
01:59:42 this is such a context specific
01:59:44 thing where he turns around
01:59:46 to a bookshelf sweeps aside items
01:59:48 discovers bullets
01:59:50 reloads gun
01:59:52 there might be a context specific animation
01:59:54 for different places
01:59:56 and why don't they have the context specific thing
01:59:58 visible on screen as we know it will be in the final game
02:00:00 because they always turn off UIs during gameplay
02:00:02 reveals and that is fucking
02:00:04 giving people false hope that it's going to be more
02:00:06 complicated and impressive than it actually
02:00:08 is they should present it as it's going
02:00:10 to be in the real game
02:00:12 Nate you're so close right now
02:00:14 to coming to a realization
02:00:16 about why capitalism is bad
02:00:18 you are like on the cusp but I know
02:00:20 you are you are right about
02:00:22 to pivot and go right in the opposite direction
02:00:24 but I want you to come back
02:00:26 I have no time for this point yet again Ben
02:00:28 let's move on and go over
02:00:30 and go over that cliff
02:00:32 and join me
02:00:34 perhaps one day
02:00:36 alright I mean
02:00:38 the thing looks like it's just well rehearsed
02:00:40 like a guy played
02:00:42 the game he pushed the things the boxes
02:00:44 to the side so you're saying
02:00:46 it is gameplay it's like high level gameplay
02:00:48 I'm saying it's a mixture of gameplay
02:00:50 like when he opens the gun
02:00:52 and he puts the bullets in
02:00:54 like him holding the gun
02:00:56 that looks like it's still like shaky
02:00:58 it's being held by somebody
02:01:00 and that's the gun opening
02:01:02 and you know
02:01:04 there are buttons on the controllers
02:01:06 so what I'm assuming happens
02:01:08 is that he's actually using his hand
02:01:10 to push the boxes out of the way
02:01:12 because you can just that simple physics calculation
02:01:14 of like you know something impacting
02:01:16 then when the bullets show up he probably hits
02:01:18 a button and it plays a canned animation
02:01:20 of picking up the bullets and reloading the gun
02:01:22 he's still holding the gun in game
02:01:24 but instead of like because you can't do that
02:01:26 with the controllers it's just a button prompt
02:01:28 and they animate it just like they would
02:01:30 any other canned reloading animation
02:01:32 it's literally at the other game
02:01:34 why in a VR I mean okay
02:01:36 you think that like the picking up of the bullet
02:01:38 and all that stuff is part of a canned animation
02:01:40 because like
02:01:42 not the picking up the bullet but the reloading the gun
02:01:44 I mean parts of it could be
02:01:46 but I mean we see how fast and smooth
02:01:48 he like picks up the bullet
02:01:50 I mean that seems a little
02:01:52 not what you're gonna get
02:01:54 he has the bullet grasped in his
02:01:56 fingers which is just seems like he's holding down the hold button
02:01:58 even the reaching out could be
02:02:00 a part of the animation like they could
02:02:02 he could just be looking at the object
02:02:04 and then
02:02:06 you hit a button and the character reaches grabs the object
02:02:08 and we don't know but like there's definitely
02:02:10 like part of it
02:02:12 as a canned animation but it's still technically
02:02:14 gameplay because it's
02:02:16 happening in the game when you're playing it it's just the
02:02:18 the prescripted animation
02:02:20 takes over at that point and like that's probably
02:02:22 a good thing because if you're in the middle of a game
02:02:24 even a VR game you probably
02:02:26 like reloading manually
02:02:28 one bullet at a time would be annoying
02:02:30 and would take a lot of your focus away from the game
02:02:32 like there's a level of abstraction
02:02:34 a level of abstraction in games is
02:02:36 important
02:02:38 this is all why I feel this is going to be disappointing
02:02:40 you know okay let's
02:02:42 we can disagree on this all day
02:02:44 well I mean of course it will be disappointing
02:02:46 because every game trailer is designed
02:02:48 to make the game look good
02:02:50 and the real game is never
02:02:52 looks quite like the trailer
02:02:54 I mean it doesn't
02:02:56 it never happens
02:02:58 perhaps we just disagree on how much
02:03:00 lower I think it's going to be vastly
02:03:02 below what's being depicted here
02:03:04 in terms of
02:03:06 I have some faith in this game
02:03:08 like maybe not being
02:03:10 incredibly amazing or living up to the
02:03:12 Half-Life pedigree but doing something to
02:03:14 move VR forward to some degree
02:03:16 is there some way we can put stakes on this
02:03:18 because I would love to bet you guys
02:03:20 I would love to do that
02:03:22 I agree that it won't be
02:03:24 like the trailer but I don't see why
02:03:26 this one in particular is going to be
02:03:28 particularly disappointing when
02:03:30 just standard procedure is to polish up
02:03:32 and show the best version of the thing
02:03:34 and the game never lives up
02:03:36 games never live up to their trailers
02:03:38 what's different about this to me
02:03:40 is that this seems to be marketed as
02:03:42 an epic real big VR game
02:03:44 and I'm definitely still
02:03:46 skeptical of those
02:03:48 what do you expect that to be
02:03:50 I expect this to be just like
02:03:52 a standard
02:03:54 Half-Life campaign
02:03:56 with VR controls
02:03:58 I mean VR controls don't even have
02:04:00 like good movement from what I understand
02:04:02 they have like weird teleporting controls
02:04:04 in like the latest stuff I've seen
02:04:06 where you have to kind of like point your guy and then you work
02:04:08 to a new spot
02:04:10 maybe that's changed I don't know
02:04:12 no no there's options for that
02:04:14 people get motion sickness from
02:04:16 from having the character
02:04:18 move like with an analog stick
02:04:20 so there's options
02:04:22 for like zipping
02:04:24 zapping all over the place it's also
02:04:26 much easier to program like that
02:04:28 sure
02:04:30 but like it's definitely
02:04:32 possible to have like a
02:04:34 you have the two controllers in your hands
02:04:36 and you imagine like a wee
02:04:38 nunchuck like your thumb has
02:04:40 the analog stick
02:04:42 and then your other fingers are free to click buttons
02:04:44 and rotate the stuff
02:04:46 so like you can move
02:04:48 with your left hand and hold the gun
02:04:50 with your right and I can see it being possible
02:04:52 I noticed that we don't actually see the player character
02:04:54 moving anywhere in the game
02:04:56 well we do in that thing that I've been playing
02:04:58 over and over where he runs over to the shelf
02:05:00 to get the bullets that's why I feel it's a canned animation
02:05:02 that's the only time there's like movement
02:05:04 and
02:05:06 my issue with this scene is that it
02:05:08 it felt to me like it's presented and even you guys
02:05:10 have said it seems like part of it seems canned
02:05:12 but maybe not all of it which makes me a little suspicious
02:05:14 of but what's wrong with a canned animation
02:05:16 that's just normal this is the normal
02:05:18 video game what's different about it is that
02:05:20 this is VR and that
02:05:22 it's I feel like there could be false
02:05:24 conclusions drawn which is I mean
02:05:26 when I first watch this I was like wow look at all the
02:05:28 this is literally my experience look at the amazing
02:05:30 thing you push over away the
02:05:32 stuff you pick up the bullet you load it then I was
02:05:34 beginning to think like wait there's
02:05:36 no way it's going to expect you to do these
02:05:38 things there has to be something else going
02:05:40 on so I mean I felt like I myself
02:05:42 am an example of
02:05:44 exactly the thing consumer not aware
02:05:46 of the limitations of hardware
02:05:48 yeah so here I am spreading
02:05:50 so how would you got how what's the complaint
02:05:52 here I am just stating what everyone should
02:05:54 know right it shouldn't be
02:05:56 as don't be impressed don't be impressed
02:05:58 like every okay
02:06:00 it's not
02:06:02 it's not going to have one for one
02:06:04 hand move obviously like that's
02:06:06 impossible nobody can do that at this point
02:06:08 I just
02:06:10 if you if your opinion of
02:06:12 this trailer is that wow everything I
02:06:14 just watch was a one-to-one interaction
02:06:16 in VR like
02:06:18 I guess that's understandable but that's
02:06:20 also like a complete like
02:06:22 fault of your interpretation because the trailer
02:06:24 is not implying that like you
02:06:26 can argue that like the medium of VR
02:06:28 promises that and so
02:06:30 you can interpret it incorrectly that way
02:06:32 but I don't think that that was
02:06:34 implicitly the idea I think it was just
02:06:36 hey you know Tom that's fair
02:06:38 it's my goal as always
02:06:40 my goal as always is just to keep
02:06:42 people with with reasonable expectation
02:06:44 so perhaps I've done too much on that
02:06:46 front but that that is my goal
02:06:48 for people to not be disappointed because
02:06:50 I'm a little suspicious of this of this project
02:06:52 specifically in terms of gameplay and nothing
02:06:54 else I don't care about the story or anything at all
02:06:56 well glad
02:06:58 I feel like do exactly what it was
02:07:00 warning us against doing
02:07:02 yeah I would never have talked about it
02:07:04 otherwise I just
02:07:06 I am a little like confused
02:07:08 about what
02:07:10 like
02:07:12 I generally
02:07:14 can't remember if the goalposts
02:07:16 switched a couple times
02:07:18 in that argument
02:07:20 like I feel like I agree
02:07:22 with your point now that you've made it at the end
02:07:24 but I wasn't agreeing
02:07:26 with it earlier the conclusion
02:07:28 that it is not one-to-one hand movement
02:07:30 is true probably
02:07:32 I remain in my initial position
02:07:34 I feel like you're advocating for a consumer
02:07:36 that doesn't exist someone who would
02:07:38 look at this and think that this is like
02:07:40 like perfect one-to-one
02:07:42 well I mean some people are gonna be gonna be
02:07:44 like wow
02:07:46 it's gonna be way worse than that
02:07:48 we I know this I know it's gonna be
02:07:50 like it's so polished in the trailer
02:07:52 like one-to-one we all know is impossible
02:07:54 but is is I don't know 50%
02:07:56 there even possible doubt it
02:07:58 what do you mean one-to-one in what
02:08:00 it's just the gameplay shown here
02:08:02 is so
02:08:04 like polished and good looking
02:08:06 and I doubt it will get even a fucking
02:08:08 like a tenth of the way to how things look
02:08:10 in this trailer I don't understand
02:08:12 I'm so mad like okay
02:08:14 are you are you just talking about the reload animation
02:08:16 I'm talking about we've been over this and we know
02:08:18 we understand that it is a canned animation
02:08:20 I mean I
02:08:22 every every fight in the game
02:08:24 every thing every piece of
02:08:26 I mean you the character doesn't
02:08:28 move at all so don't don't expect that
02:08:30 I you know if they would have shown that
02:08:32 if that's something that happens in the game
02:08:34 the the hands up don't shoot thing obviously
02:08:36 that's gonna be a canned animation so like how much
02:08:38 impressive stuff really was there why are people excited
02:08:40 for this I don't know it just looks like the same
02:08:42 show I've seen a million times in a million VR games
02:08:44 it's a fucking half-life game and it's in VR
02:08:46 like what why wouldn't if you like
02:08:48 half-life and or VR why wouldn't you
02:08:50 like this as long as we can all agree
02:08:52 that nothing impressive has happened here
02:08:54 I think we could all agree
02:08:56 it just looks like a fucking VR game
02:08:58 I mean with a lot of money I'm genuinely
02:09:00 confused like I feel like
02:09:02 the goalposts have moved like 20 times
02:09:04 like what are you
02:09:06 I can't I can't
02:09:08 my head around what your point is
02:09:10 because every time
02:09:12 any of us say anything you come up
02:09:14 with a different thing that I
02:09:16 I can't people in the comments
02:09:18 people in the comics please explain
02:09:20 like what was Nate initially
02:09:22 saying and why am I confused now

02:10:44 well that was a
02:10:46 palette cleanser when there was a
02:10:48 there was a follow-up message from from riddle my ass
02:10:50 Batman let's uh let's hear him out here we go
02:10:54 happy Thanksgiving everybody riddle my
02:10:56 ass Batman here thank you did you enjoy my
02:10:58 singing I know you didn't
02:11:00 that's why he's joking with you anyway
02:11:02 now I was debating on what to get you
02:11:04 for Christmas this year at first I thought
02:11:06 I'd get to a gym membership
02:11:08 but then I realized you'll never use
02:11:10 it then I thought I'd get to a girlfriend
02:11:12 and I realized you don't know how to use that
02:11:14 so instead I decided on something simple
02:11:16 I get to
02:11:18 a new voicemail series
02:11:20 that's right coming this Christmas a new
02:11:22 300 part voicemail series
02:11:24 wait I found the budget
02:11:26 a new 10 part
02:11:28 voicemail series
02:11:30 with only voicemails per episode of the
02:11:32 PCP for 10 weeks straight
02:11:34 oh my god now you have a reason to watch the
02:11:36 PCP again
02:11:38 see you Christmas everybody
02:11:40 same PCP time same PCP channel
02:11:42 that's like a PCP
02:11:44 or a Peter Griffin Christmas
02:11:46 album with riddle my ass Batman
02:11:48 you know
02:11:50 I hope it's good
02:11:52 he sent in another one that was too long
02:11:54 and not great so I didn't play it
02:11:56 riddle my ass Batman
02:11:58 so maybe just pick the best
02:12:00 of each of them and we can maybe pair this down a bit
02:12:02 I think three voicemails
02:12:04 of a song each time is a bit much
02:12:06 maybe we can do
02:12:08 one a week or something I don't know
02:12:10 but there it is
02:12:12 I'm looking forward to it nonetheless
02:12:14 these songs always bring delay
02:12:16 leave us wanting more
02:12:18 keep us wanting more riddle my ass Batman
02:12:20 oh incidentally we've got
02:12:22 one last voicemail and this is from
02:12:24 thems tapes
02:12:26 number one thems tapes
02:12:28 let's hear it
02:12:30 mysterious
02:12:36 it's hot
02:12:38 why is it so hot
02:12:40 I've been stuck in this desert for
02:12:42 months and I still can't figure
02:12:44 out why there is so much
02:12:46 sand I'm so
02:12:48 thirsty but no matter where I
02:12:50 look I can't find a single drop
02:12:52 of bloge to quench my
02:12:54 thirst how did it come
02:12:56 to this wow is my life
02:12:58 like this things were
02:13:00 supposed to be different after we killed
02:13:02 munchy but it's only gotten
02:13:04 worse I've been stranded
02:13:06 out here for months and no one has
02:13:08 come to help me I can't
02:13:10 rely on them anymore
02:13:12 of all of my own
02:13:14 but
02:13:16 there's one who could
02:13:18 help me to answer my
02:13:20 questions my burning snake
02:13:22 questions however
02:13:24 he is split in two
02:13:26 one half in prison one
02:13:28 half in goo what shall
02:13:30 I do how can he
02:13:32 uncover the secrets without
02:13:34 access to the tapes
02:13:36 the tapes
02:13:38 surely one holds the secret
02:13:40 to releasing his other half
02:13:42 from prison and making
02:13:44 him whole once again
